# EVSI validation findings (2026-06, Phase 1 — P1a calibration + P1c ablations)

The Phase-1 test of the central question: **does a high `value` / EVSI actually predict a question
whose answer improves the response?** Verdict up front: **the Δ component is directionally calibrated,
but the full stakes-weighted EVSI is NOT-yet-validated, and the `U` factor is inert.** Reproduced
independently and stress-tested by adversarial refutation (4 claims) — see "Verification" below.
**Directional, not settled** — 51 answer-rows / 17 questions / **3 prompt clusters**.

## Setup

- **Harness:** `evals/validate_evsi.py` → rows; `evals/analyze_evsi.py` → stats (pure-stdlib,
  no scipy). Run on the host against `localhost:11434`, incremental writes.
- **Design.** For each prompt, run info-gain (focus, 1 round) to get ranked questions with their
  **projected** scores (`projected_delta`/`stakes`/`prob` per answer; `U`/`EVSI`/`value` per question,
  EVSI from the **shipped deepseek judge**). Then for each (question, answer): inject the answer as an
  established fact, **re-derive** the baseline response, and have a strong blind judge rate
  `realized_change` ∈ [0,1] = how much the response actually moved vs the no-evidence baseline.
- **Prompts:** `buy-rent` (6 q), `gtm-plan` (6 q), `remote-hybrid` (5 q). usaw-calendar excluded
  (the benchmark showed it's a niche-domain/model failure, not a rating problem).
- **Targets.** `realized_change` is the only thing **measured**. Per-question aggregates:
  `realized_change_q = Σ P'·realized_change` (P' = prob renormalized over tested answers) and
  `realized_evsi_q = Σ P'·realized_change·stakes` — note this **reuses projected `stakes`** (see the
  measurement gap), so it is **not** a clean ground truth.

## Results

**P1a — calibration (the Δ judge).** Projected Δ tracks realized change, directionally:

| projected_delta bin | n | mean realized_change |
|---|---:|---:|
| [0.0, 0.2) | 3 | 0.43 |
| [0.2, 0.4) | 9 | 0.52 |
| [0.4, 0.6) | 8 | 0.56 |
| [0.6, 0.8) | 17 | 0.75 |
| [0.8, 1.0] | 14 | 0.83 |

- per-answer **Spearman(projected_delta, realized_change) = +0.394** (quartile binning strictly
  monotone 0.45→0.56→0.75→0.83). Cluster-respecting (question-level) permutation **p = 0.005**;
  prompt-cluster bootstrap 95% CI [0.235, 0.662]; survives drop-one-prompt (min 0.243, always positive).
- **realized_change saturates: 71% (36/51) sit at exactly 0.0 or 1.0** — the change judge is coarse,
  so most rank signal lives in the extremes (binarizing at 0.5 drops ρ to 0.21).

**P1c — formula ablations** (mean per-prompt Spearman vs each target):

| formula | vs realized_change (clean) | vs realized_evsi (confounded) |
|---|---:|---:|
| `value = √(U·EVSI)` | +0.153 | **+0.848** |
| EVSI-only | +0.153 | **+0.848** |
| mean-Δ (P-weighted) | +0.195 | +0.795 |
| **max-Δ** (max over answers) | **+0.526** | +0.784 |
| U-only | +0.147 | +0.102 |

- vs the **clean** signal, `value`/EVSI ≈ 0 (per-question ρ = **−0.009**); **max-Δ is the best
  predictor (+0.526)** and the only one positive in all three prompts (0.892/0.239/0.447).
- `value` and EVSI-only are **byte-identical** — `U` never changes within-prompt order.

## The confound (why +0.848/+0.605 is not validation)

`realized_evsi_q = Σ P'·realized_change·**stakes**` recycles the same projected `stakes` already
inside `EVSI = Σ P·Δ·stakes`. `q_evsi` is **0.96-collinear** with mean stakes, so the partial
correlation controlling for stakes **collapses +0.605 → −0.13**, and stakes *alone* predicts
`realized_evsi_q` as well or better. **≈100% of EVSI's apparent "validation" is the stakes factor
correlating with itself.** Against the one unconfounded signal (`realized_change`), EVSI is null.

## Measurement gap (what blocks clean validation)

We measured realized **Δ** (did the response change) but never realized **stakes** (did the change
matter). Since `EVSI = Σ P·Δ·stakes`, any "realized EVSI" must substitute projected stakes for the
missing realized stakes → the target shares a factor with the predictor. **We can validate the Δ
half; we cannot validate the stakes half, hence not the full formula.** (Even the "clean" Δ signal is
mildly stakes-entangled: projected stakes alone predicts realized_change at answer level ρ=0.417,
p=0.002.)

## Verification (independent reproduce + adversarial refute)

`Workflow: verify-evsi-calibration` — 1 reproduction agent + 4 adversarial skeptics (one per claim) +
synthesis. All 5 headline numbers reproduced within rounding; verdicts:

| claim | verdict | confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **A** — Δ-judge directionally calibrated (ρ=0.39) | **supported** | medium (magnitude leans on gtm-plan; sign robust, cluster p=0.005) |
| **B** — `U` is inert → drop it | **supported** | high (0/40 within-prompt reorderings; U-only anti-predictive) |
| **C** — EVSI confounded; clean-signal null; max-Δ best | **supported** | high (partial-ρ\|stakes = −0.13; max-Δ marginal, p=0.064) |
| **D** — n=17/3-cluster too underpowered to rank formulas | **partial** | per-prompt power *is* fatal; pooled n=17 is OK but its winner rides the confound |

## What it means for the rating

1. **`U` (uncertainty) is inert *for ranking*** in this sample (range-compressed 0.725–0.984) and
   anti-predictive on its own. `√(U·EVSI)` ranks identically to EVSI. **But `U` is load-bearing for the
   *gate*** (`is_gated_out`: `derivable_prob`→1 → `U`→0 retires answered questions across rounds) — the
   ablation only tested the ranking role. So a future "drop U" removes it from the `value` number
   **only**, keeping the derivability gate. *Hedge:* inertness unproven beyond this narrow U spread;
   one buy-rent pair came within 0.002 of flipping.
2. **The full EVSI is not-yet-validated.** Don't ship the ranker on this evidence; **gate the Phase-2
   wrapper on a de-confounded #21.** Stop citing +0.605 as validation — it's a stakes-reuse artifact.
   **Decision (2026-06): freeze the formula — no changes on n=17;** #21 decides every formula question.
3. **max-Δ is a live contender** (best clean-signal predictor) but **marginal** (p=0.064) — a
   hypothesis to test in #21, not a switch to flip now.
4. **Floor: defer.** Directionally a floor exists (low-Δ questions realize ~0.43 vs ~0.83 at top), but
   its numeric location is not estimable at n=17 / with a saturating judge. Set it from #21's blind
   improvement-vs-value curve.

## Reshaped next experiment (#21, hard requirements)

Run the grounded validity study (baseline vs top-K vs low-K, blind-judged, pass = top > low ≥ baseline)
**plus**: (a) an **independent blind realized-stakes judgment** (rate the *importance* of the
differences, not just whether they changed) so a realized EVSI can be computed **without** reusing
projected stakes — the only way to break the ρ=0.96 collinearity; (b) **register max-Δ** as a named
competitor against √(U·EVSI) / EVSI-only / U-only on the blind realized-improvement axis;
(c) **pool across many more than 3 prompts** with a prompt-cluster bootstrap CI. The improvement-vs-value
curve also yields `diminishing_floor`.

## Domain sensitivity — the value structure is domain-bound (a 3-regime spectrum)

The Phase-1 numbers above were measured on **generic life questions** — which turn out to be a
degenerate corner. The real target is **agentic / tool-access / coding** tasks. A value-structure
scan across a **34-prompt, 17-category bank** (`evals/testbank.py` + `evals/score_scan.py`, deepseek
judge) shows the life conclusions do **not** transfer:

| | U spread | derivable_prob | value < 0.40 (life-tuned) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LIFE** | sd **0.07**, [0.72–0.98] | mean 0.01, [0.00–0.10] | **11%** |
| **AGENTIC** | sd **0.26**, [0.02–0.98] | mean 0.15, [0.00–0.95] | **61%** |

In life questions all uncertainty is **homogeneous, non-derivable user-intent**, so U is pinned high
and inert. Agentic tasks span a wide **derivability** axis, and as `derivable_prob` rises, `U` falls
and the bucket empties — sorted by category (mean over all scored candidates):

```

**Three usage regimes, mapped onto the skill's three levers:**
1. **Ask-the-user** (spec-heavy: planning, coding features, security audits, finance) — high U, low
   `derivable_prob`, real EVSI. The skill produces genuine clarifying questions, exactly as for life.
2. **Go-find-out** (research / knowledge / retrieval: web-research, `explain-oauth`, calendar sync) —
   high `derivable_prob` → the **U-gate fires** (`U`→0) → few/no user questions. The skill is already
   signalling *"don't ask, resolve this by research"* — which is precisely the **Phase-2 grounded
   answerer's** trigger. `explain-oauth` (deriv 0.90, U 0.04, 0 questions) is the gate working perfectly.
3. **Just-do-it** (data pulls, sends, file ops, email summaries) — low `EVSI`/value: the answer
   wouldn't change the plan, so assume the modal default. The skill correctly discards these.

**What this overturns / sharpens:**
- **"Drop U" is dead in the target domain.** U's spread is 0.26 here (not 0.07) and it is the
  **ask-vs-find-out discriminator** (regime 1 vs 2) via `derivable_prob`. Removing it would erase that
  routing. The freeze decision was correct — the n=17 life-only "U inert" was a domain artifact.
- **Rank-relative selection (#23) is required, not "likely."** The life-tuned 0.40 cutoff discards 61%
  of agentic candidates — and for *different reasons per regime* (regime 2: low U; regime 3: low value;
  and regime 1's legitimate questions are also pushed under as the whole distribution shifts down).
  An absolute threshold cannot serve a domain this heterogeneous; select by rank / round-relative.
- **The skill's derivability gate is already doing Phase-2's job.** The go-find-out regime is exactly
  where the iterate-context wrapper's grounded research (and NOT_FOUND tombstones) earns out; info-gain
  flags it via `U`→0. This is design-validating, not a defect.

**Implication for #21:** validate on the **agentic bank**, not life questions — and analyze **per
regime** (a single pooled number would average three different mechanisms into mush).

### Agentic realized calibration (the reversal)

A realized-change run on the agentic domain (one prompt per regime — `add-auth`/`gmail-triage`/
`research-ratelimit`, `--source all_scored`, n=54 answers / 18 questions) shows the **calibration is
stronger here than on life, and — unlike life — EVSI/value predict the clean realized-change signal:**

| | per-answer ρ(Δ, realized) | per-q EVSI vs realized_**change** | per-q value vs realized_change |
|---|---|---|---|
| LIFE | +0.39 | **−0.009** (null) | +0.11 |
| AGENTIC | **+0.64** | **+0.70** | **+0.66** |

Calibration curve monotone 0.16→0.26→0.48→0.76→0.98. The life-domain null was an artifact of the
**compressed** life value distribution (no variance to predict); the target domain has real spread, so
the formula discriminates. **This partially rehabilitates EVSI for the actual use case** — but with two
honest qualifiers:
- **Mostly between-regime.** The strength comes from correctly separating tasks (value/realized means:
  ask-user 0.50/0.87, just-do-it 0.18/0.18, go-find-out 0.11/0.14 — monotone). **Within** a task the
  ranking is positive but modest (avg per-prompt ρ ≈ 0.34). So the formula is excellent at *"which task
  needs clarification at all"* and decent at *"which question within a task."*
- **Stakes still unmeasured.** value-vs-realized-**change** (+0.66) is clean (no stakes), but the full
  `EVSI = Σ P·Δ·stakes` still can't be validated without realized stakes (realized-EVSI +0.89 remains a
  projected-stakes confound). n=18 / 3 prompts / 72% saturation — directional.

Net verdict shift: **the Δ-half and the cross-task value ranking show real signal in the target domain
(a clear improvement over the life-only read); the stakes-weighting and within-task ranking still ride
on the powered, de-confounded #21.**

### The realized-stakes instrument is the hard part (→ go comparative)

Building #21's de-confounding step surfaced a methodological wall. To break the projected-stakes
confound we must measure realized **stakes** independently (`evals/validate_evsi.py::stakes_judge`,
`analyze_validity.py`). An **absolute** post-hoc stakes judge proved too fragile:
- **Catastrophe anchor** ("how materially worse… serious problems") → collapse: **35/36 rated 0.0**,
  only the *compliance* question (genuinely legal-grade) got 1.0. Zero variance → de-confounded test
  uninformative (value vs realized_regret ρ=+0.26, but realized_regret was ≈0 everywhere).
- **Graded anchor** ("would a knowledgeable user care… full range") → variance returns (mean 0.62,
  sd 0.15) and becomes distinct from realized_change, **but central-tendency clusters** (12/18 snap to
  0.6). Better, still not discriminating.

So the realized judges are fragile in **opposite** ways — change saturates at 0/1, stakes piles on the
middle anchor. Note the *projected* deepseek stakes is sensibly graded (sd 0.26; auth 0.70 / scale 0.10
/ compliance 0.95) — it's the post-hoc *measurement* of stakes that resists absolute rating.

**Conclusion — promote comparative elicitation (1.4 / #24) from conditional to the path forward.**
Models are far better at **relative** judgments than calibrated absolute numbers. The de-confounded
study should measure realized stakes **pairwise** — *"for this prompt, which of these two clarifications
matters more for the outcome?"* — yielding a ranking (Bradley-Terry / Elo) instead of brittle 0–1
ratings. The same likely applies to *eliciting* projected stakes. Until then the **stakes-half of EVSI
remains unvalidated by instrument limitation** (not by a negative result); the **Δ-half stands**
(agentic per-answer ρ 0.64, value-vs-realized-change 0.66).

## Wrapper end-to-end (the honest verdict)

The #21 end-to-end test (`evals/validate_wrapper.py`): for each prompt, produce a baseline response
(answer no clarifying questions) and a wrapper response (research the top-K via grounded `ask`, then
respond), blind-judge which better serves the user. Findings — and the confound that nearly buried them:

- **First pass (default env) → baseline 2-0.** But inspection killed the conclusion: the test runs in
  a synthetic container with **10 projects** under `/opt/data/projects/`, so "add auth to my web app"
  is genuinely ambiguous, and the grounded answerer ran in the install cwd (`/opt/hermes`) — it found
  the Hermes codebase and honestly said "no web app here" while the baseline picked a real project
  (`fastapi-tasks`) and delivered. A **fair, balanced re-judge** (penalizing over-assumption *and*
  punting, ignoring length) still favored baseline — because the baseline **is itself a capable
  investigating agent**, so a redundant k=1 clarification couldn't beat it.
- **De-confounded (both pinned to the real project, responder given file tools) → 1-1 (k=1).**
  `add-auth` → **wrapper wins** (researching the actual stack yields a "complete, production-ready
  implementation"); `fix-test` → **baseline wins** ("correctly identifies the missing test files" — a
  capable agent just investigates the failure directly; the clarification is redundant).

**Verdict:** the wrapper is **not a universal win over a capable baseline agent** — its value is
**task-dependent**. It helps where a clarification *shapes* the work (build/spec tasks: knowing the
stack/constraints changes the implementation) and is redundant where the agent can *self-investigate*
(debug tasks). Its **distinctive, non-redundant value is the genuinely user-only constraints** a
capable agent can't investigate away. Two real levers were found and fixed: the grounded answerer's
**`cwd`** must be the user's project (`answer_cwd`/`responder_cwd`), and the responder's tools.

**Caveats:** n=2 de-confounded, k=1, single project, one judge — directional, not settled. k≥2 and
genuinely user-only-constraint prompts are where the wrapper should show its clearest edge.

**Implication:** ship the wrapper as a working v1 (ranking validated via realized_change; mechanically
correct; de-confounded it holds its own). The strategic open question is emphasis: autonomous research
loop (redundant with capable agents on investigable tasks) vs **surfacing the ranked user-only
clarifications** (the report-only strength — the non-redundant value). Left for the user to steer.

## Stop + breadth calibration (saturation + realized-improvement scans)

Two cheap scans to set the "how wide to start" (breadth) and "when to stop evaluating" (floor) numbers
from evidence instead of guesses (`evals/saturation_scan.py`; binning of the realized-change data).

**Breadth — coverage does NOT saturate.** `saturation_scan.py` (distinct-target count vs `gen_samples`
1→6, 5 prompts across domains) climbs monotonically — ~6→11→18→22→28→34 distinct targets, **~5–6 new
distinct targets per *added* sample even at 5→6**, no knee in any domain. The model has an effectively
unbounded supply of distinct questions, so **"generate until coverage saturates" is the wrong breadth
rule** — more breadth just adds a low-value tail. ⇒ breadth must be bounded by **value, not coverage**;
keep the initial breadth **modest**, and let the **families layer** do structured coverage (it targets
high-value *regions* — scoped/contrarian/vantage — rather than sampling the tail). Don't raise sample counts.

**Floor — realized-improvement knee at value ≈ 0.30.** Binning the n=105 realized pairs (agentic + life)
by projected `q_value`:

| q_value bin | mean realized_change |
|---|---|
| [0.00, 0.15) | 0.20 |
| [0.15, 0.30) | 0.13 |
| **[0.30, 0.45)** | **0.67** |
| [0.45, 0.60) | 0.73 |
| [0.60, 1.0] | 0.75 |

Clean knee at ~0.30: below it questions barely move the response (~0.15), above it they substantially
do (~0.70). The relative version agrees (below 0.33·top → 0.20; above → 0.56–0.75). **Course-correction:
the absolute floor isn't *wrong* — the domain-scan's "61% below 0.40" are mostly genuinely-low-value
go-find-out/just-do-it questions that *should* be dropped; 0.40 was simply mis-calibrated.** ⇒
**`discard_threshold` 0.40 → 0.30** (recovers the 0.30–0.40 band, realized 0.67, that 0.40 wrongly
dropped). The relative-knee mechanism (`rel_keep_frac`, §voi) is built and available but stays **off** —
the calibrated absolute is better-supported and simpler; flip it on only for a domain whose top value
runs below the floor.

*Caveats:* n=105, mixed-domain, `realized_change` saturates at 0/1 (coarse); the de-confounded #21
(pairwise stakes) gives the clean number. Breadth scan is generation-only (distinct targets, not value)
— the value-saturation curve (scored) is the stronger confirmation, now available via
`saturation_scan.py --scored` (full pipeline per breadth: tracks max(value) + #candidates ≥ floor).

**Scored confirmation (`--scored`, 5 prompts, breadth 1→4) — the high-value signal saturates at breadth
≈2 while coverage doesn't.** `max(value)` per prompt is flat past ~2 draws (median value-knee = 2; avg
Δmax_value per *added* sample = +0.046 / −0.029 / +0.038 — noise around zero), even though distinct
targets keep climbing (+1.2 / +2.6 / +3.8 per sample) and the #candidates ≥ floor keeps growing (e.g.
add-auth 6→7→11→11, deploy 4→7→10→9). So extra breadth surfaces a *mid-value tail* that clears the floor
but never a *better top* — the best questions are found in the first ~2 draws. This is the stronger
confirmation of the coverage-scan conclusion: **breadth is bounded by value, not coverage** → keep the
initial breadth modest and let the **families layer** do structured high-value coverage. (research-ratelimit
is the go-find-out outlier — max value 0.18–0.37, ≤1 above floor — exactly the regime where high
derivability gates value down.) No change to the shipped breadth knobs.

## Comparative elicitation (#24) — the within-task ranking experiment

**The target.** Between regimes, value predicts realized improvement well (ρ≈0.66). The one weakness is
**within-task** ranking — per-prompt mean Spearman ρ≈0.34: given one task's candidate questions, the
top-ranked isn't reliably the most valuable. Hypothesis: the cause is **absolute** 0-1 Δ/stakes
elicitation (models score poorly in isolation), and **comparative** elicitation (forced choices, which
models do well) should rank better within a task.

**The instrument** (`scripts/pairwise.py` + `pipeline.judge_plan_change_pairwise`): for each question,
compare its answers PAIRWISE ("which changes the response more?" / "which matters more?"), aggregate via
Bradley-Terry, and write the SAME per-answer `delta_plan`/`stakes` the absolute judge writes — a drop-in
for `voi.evsi`/`score_record`. **Between-task scale is preserved** by two virtual anchors present in
every question's set — FLOOR ("no change") → 0, CEILING ("completely different") → 1 — so a question
whose answers merely tie FLOOR lands near 0 (low EVSI) and a high-impact one lands high; pairwise fixes
within-question ordering without flattening cross-question magnitude (unit-tested:
`test_scale_preserved_across_questions`).

**The gate** (`validate_evsi --ab` → `analyze_evsi.ab_within_task`): both methods are scored on the SAME
question/answer set with the realized measurement shared (only elicitation differs); each method's
within-task mean ρ is reported per realized target. **The gate ranks on `realized_regret` (PRIMARY) — the
realized-EVSI analog (realized_change × realized_stakes), i.e. exactly what `q_value=√(U·EVSI)` predicts —
with `realized_stakes`/`realized_change` alongside.** Decision rule: adopt pairwise ONLY if it beats
absolute by Δρ>0.02 on the primary AND the per-prompt paired Δρ is *broad* (majority of prompts, beyond
~1 SE) — not a 1-2-outlier mean. Off by default (`value_judge_mode="absolute"`), so the experiment cannot
regress the live skill.

**RESULTS — POWERED (12-prompt `REALIZED_SUBSET`, 72 questions / 216 pairs per arm, local `fast` judge
fixed across both arms; 0 errors).** Within-task mean Spearman ρ (q_value vs target):

| target | absolute | pairwise | paired Δρ (pw−abs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **realized_regret** (PRIMARY, realized EVSI) | **+0.360** | +0.204 | −0.156 (pw wins 3/12) |
| realized_stakes | **+0.249** | +0.229 | −0.020 (pw wins 6/12) |
| realized_change | **+0.297** | +0.145 | — |

**Verdict: KEEP `absolute` — #24 CLOSED as a (mild-negative) null.** With power, pairwise elicitation is
not merely non-inferior, it is **slightly worse** on every realized target (loses 9/12 prompts on regret).
The comparative-elicitation hypothesis does not hold for *projected* Δ/stakes; pairwise stays built + off
as a **documented negative result**.

**Two n=6 sub-narratives were SMALL-SAMPLE NOISE (corrected here):** (a) "realized_change is
within-task-dead (ρ≈0.04)" — at n=12 it is **+0.297**, not dead; the n=6 ≈0 was noise, same as everything
else at n=6. (b) "pairwise edges ahead (+0.07 on stakes)" — at n=12 it is **−0.02**. The adversarial
agent's core call was right: **the binding limit was power, and the powered re-test confirmed a null.**
(This is also why the earlier "saturation" *and* "stakes is the unique within-task signal" readings were
both over-claims — at power, all three realized targets carry within-task signal for the absolute judge.)

**Strong POSITIVE — the frozen formula is validated within-task.** The `p1c` ablation against
`realized_regret` (n=12) ranks `value √(U·EVSI)` **best (+0.360)**, above **U-only (+0.264), EVSI-only
(+0.202), stakes-only (+0.157), mean-Δ (+0.153), max-Δ (+0.075)** — the full geometric-mean form beats
*every* component alone. So within-task ranking is **modest-but-real** (ρ≈0.36, consistent with the
original ρ≈0.34), and √(U·EVSI) earns its keep. **The formula stays FROZEN — now with within-task support,
not just between-regime.**

**Do NOT build the comparative realized judge:** pairwise doesn't help even on *projected* elicitation, so
a realized-pairwise measurement would be pointless. The between-question validity is intact (per-answer
projected_delta vs realized_change Pearson +0.39; per-question projected-EVSI vs realized-EVSI healthy).

## Pre-mortem lens tier-2 (#25) + selection policies (#23) — realized two-arm (2026-07-01)

**Setup:** `validate_evsi --families --premortem off|on --source all_scored --keep-responses`,
6 prompts (security-audit, deploy-app, add-auth, query-db + read-only controls gmail-triage,
research-ratelimit) × 2 arms, all-fast pinned models (gen + elicit + judge), max_answers 2.
off = 152 answer-rows / 76 questions; on = 184 / 92. Analyzed with `analyze_evsi` (`per_lens` +
`selection_policies`, added for this study).

**#25 realized verdict — the lens EARNS its bucket slots (tier-1's projected win is real):**
- On-arm per-lens realized_regret (P′-weighted): **premortem 0.416** — the TOP lens (scoped 0.297,
  contrarian 0.240, vantage 0.253), despite the lowest-but-one projected value (0.316). Its
  realized_change (0.612) and realized_stakes (0.508) also lead.
- **Failure-surface vs read-only differential** (the pre-registered do-no-harm evidence): on
  failure-surface prompts pm questions realize regret **0.602 vs 0.386** for all other lenses
  (~1.6×); on read-only prompts (lens FORCED on) pm regret is **0.045** — below even the other
  questions' 0.072 — and scoring prices them at 0.064, i.e. correctly pruned. Auto-on is now
  confirmed at both ladder tiers; the rollback trigger stays untripped.
- Note the asymmetry: on failure surfaces the risk-neutral score (0.443) *under*-prices realized
  pm value (0.602). The deferred risk-averse tilt remains the known lever — still scoring-side,
  still FROZEN.

**#23 selection-policy verdict — do NOT flip `rel_keep_frac`:** realized_regret capture per policy
(on-arm; ~15.3 scored questions/prompt) — abs≥0.30: 0.57 @ 8.2 kept · rel≥0.6·top: 0.46 @ 6.7 ·
top-5: 0.34 · top-3: 0.19. Every policy sits within ~0.03 of its **size-matched random baseline**
(keeping k of n captures ≈ k/n under weak ranking): 0.54, 0.44, 0.33, 0.20 respectively. So no
q_value-based selection rule adds within-task lift over its size on this data — the calibrated
absolute floor works by *size adaptation*, not within-task discrimination, and rank-relative has
no edge to justify flipping. The **within-task ranking weakness stays the binding constraint**
(here P1c: value-vs-regret mean within-prompt ρ = +0.13).

**Instrument notes:**
- Between-task calibration is healthy on this all-fast dataset: per-answer projected-Δ vs
  realized_change ρ ≈ 0.50–0.54; per-question value vs realized_change ρ ≈ 0.60; projected-EVSI
  vs realized-EVSI ρ ≈ 0.78–0.83.
- **P1c is instrument-sensitive:** on all-fast rows U-only ranks best within-task (+0.23) with
  √(U·EVSI) at +0.13 — the reverse of the deepseek-elicited #24 ablation (√ best, +0.360). A
  within-task ablation verdict evidently does not transfer across elicit/judge models; formula
  FROZEN regardless.
- Saturation confirmed live: 33–36% of realized_change rows sit exactly at 0/1 (mostly 1.0).
- **Graded change judge: REJECTED (negative result).** `rejudge.py` A/B on 60 stored pairs
  (identical texts, same fast judge): endpoint mass drops 36.7% → 13.3% as intended, but the
  instrument **collapses onto its own anchors** (4 distinct values vs the original's 7) and the
  q_value↔realized link degrades 0.60 → 0.38 (agreement ρ between instruments 0.76). Same
  central-tendency-onto-anchors failure as the earlier graded realized-stakes attempt (12/18 at
  0.6). The original 0/1-anchored judge stays the default; `--graded-change-judge` + `rejudge.py`
  remain as the harness for testing future variants (finer anchors, stronger judge model) cheaply
  on stored responses.

### Independent replication (#25, same day, different instruments) — verdict CONFIRMED ×2

A second, independently designed run of the ladder (different session; deepseek realized judge
instead of all-fast, `--source bucket` instead of `all_scored`, different prompt subset:
deploy-app, setup-ci, whatsapp-send, fix-test + read-only gmail-reply, slack-catchup) reproduced
both verdicts, plus two pieces the primary study didn't cover:

- **Bank-wide two-arm scan (34 prompts × off/auto + forced-on LIFE probe, pre-gate-fix):** lens
  fired on 14/34; on failure-surface prompts its questions survive on merit (deploy-app 3/3 kept
  at 0.42–0.59, setup-ci 0.74/0.57, whatsapp-send 3/3, fix-test 0.51/0.58); on read-only misfire
  prompts scoring pruned 17/18 (single borderline 0.30 keeper). LIFE controls: frac-below-thr
  33.9%→32.7% (no inflation), buckets byte-identical sizes. This scan ran with the OLD noun-tripping
  gate — i.e. even pre-fix, self-pruning alone already held the do-no-harm line; the gate fix
  removes the wasted generation calls (~+1.1 candidates/prompt bank-wide).
- **Realized (deepseek judge):** premortem again TOP lens — per-question realized_change 0.984,
  realized_regret 0.765 vs scoped 0.476 / contrarian 0.346 (n_q=6, all on the 3 failure-surface
  prompts; zero premortem questions entered read-only buckets). Its keepers are the archetypes
  (rollback strategy, pending schema migrations, failed-build security validation).
- **Rollback trigger #2 (adjudicator `diversity`) explicitly cleared:** `run_evals.py --families`
  two-arm over the CI cases — mean diversity 0.65 (off) → 0.70 (auto); one case −0.2 within
  single-rep judge noise; reverse-string degenerate (empty bucket both arms). Acceptability
  identical across arms (2/4; both failures arm-independent — usaw known-bad, and reverse-string
  now fails `framing_accuracy`=0.2 in BOTH arms: pre-existing, not premortem, worth a look).
  **RESOLVED (2026-07-03):** two compounding causes, both fixed. (1) Instrument: with an empty
  bucket, `question_relevance` (REQUIRED_FOR_ACCEPT) is *vacuous* and how a judge encodes N/A is
  model luck — `fast` scored it 0.0 while its own reason said the empty bucket was correct; other
  judges dump the noise elsewhere (the 0.2 `framing_accuracy` sighting). `adjudicator.adjudicate`
  now drops `question_relevance` from the required set when zero questions are kept (`calibration`
  alone carries the empty-bucket verdict; pinned in tests). (2) Genuine framing blemish: `fast`'s
  `decision`/`baseline_plan` leaked the framing stage's own JSON-schema instructions ("output the
  requested JSON structure") — `frame_prompt` now states that `decision`/`baseline_plan` describe
  the response to the PROMPT, never this JSON. Post-fix: reverse-string acceptable=True (bucket 0,
  clean framing "a Python function"); underspecified control internal-doc-search unregressed
  (bucket 5, framing_accuracy 1.0).

Same-day convergence from two differently-confounded instruments (all-fast vs fast-gen/deepseek-judge;
all_scored vs bucket; 14-cell vs 34-prompt scan) is the strongest form of this evidence: **auto-on
stands; rollback trigger untripped on both criteria.** Raw runs: `~/.hermes/tmp/infogain_premortem/`
(scan_off/scan_auto/scan_life_forced_on, ve_off/ve_auto, evals_off/evals_auto).

## Sampled P(a) (#26) — the input-calibration experiment (2026-07-02)

Research motivation (see `algorithm-review-2026-07.md`): BED-LLM (arXiv:2508.21184) and OPEN
(arXiv:2403.05534) show LLM self-stated probabilities are miscalibrated and Monte-Carlo sampled
distributions materially better — the strongest frontier critique that maps onto our within-task
weakness. #26 tested it behind the standard gate: `answer_prob_mode=sampled` (N=6 forced-choice
draws, shuffled options, Laplace α=0.5 → empirical P(a); stated survives as `stated_prob`), A/B'd
via `validate_evsi --ab-probs` — the run samples, the stated arm is a free re-score of the SAME
records, realized measured once over the union of each arm's top-3 answers.

**Setup:** powered n=12 REALIZED_SUBSET, all-`fast` pinned (gen/elicit/judge — the reproducible
host recipe), `--source all_scored --keep-responses`. 488 rows / 244 shared realized pairs / 72
questions, 21 min wall. Raw: `~/.hermes/evsi_probs_ab.json` (+ smoke `~/.hermes/tmp/evsi_probs_smoke.json`).

**VERDICT — #26 CLOSED, KEEP STATED (powered null).**

| target | stated mean ρ | sampled mean ρ | paired Δρ (sampled−stated) | wins | gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| realized_regret (PRIMARY) | +0.356 | +0.366 | **+0.010** (sd 0.39, se 0.11) | 4/12 | keep stated |
| realized_stakes | +0.266 | +0.307 | +0.041 (sd 0.42, se 0.12) | 7/12 | keep stated |
| realized_change | +0.325 | +0.308 | — | — | — |

- **The null is real, not a no-contrast artifact:** the arms disagreed on 79% of pairs
  (|ΔP| > 0.05) and shifted q_value on 76% — a materially different P estimate produced the same
  within-task discrimination. The forced-choice machinery itself worked (zero fallbacks observed in
  the smoke; live divergence throughout).
- **Interpretation (mirrors #24):** the binding within-task weakness is not P(a) miscalibration.
  With a coarse 0/1-saturating realized target and utility weighting (Δplan·stakes) dominating the
  expectation, sharpening P buys nothing detectable at n=12. BED-LLM's calibration gains were
  measured on multi-class prediction success, not utility-weighted question ranking — they do not
  transfer here.
- **Bonus independent replication of the frozen formula:** this run's p1c ablation ranks
  `√(U·EVSI)` best on ALL THREE realized targets — regret **+0.356** (prior study: +0.360), stakes
  +0.266, change +0.325, above every component ablation each time. Third independent within-task
  validation.
- **Instrument notes:** judge = `fast` (qwen3.6:35b-a3b) — `gpt-oss:20b` is UNUSABLE as a judge
  through `raw_chat` (reasoning-channel model returns empty `message.content`; every realized value
  nulls). Realized saturation 39% at extremes (68 of 244 at 1.0) — better than the historical 71%
  but still coarse.

Sampled stays built + off (`--answer-prob-mode sampled` for re-testing). Do NOT build free-form
answer rollouts on this evidence — the cheap hybrid already moved P materially with no ranking gain.

## Solution-space Δplan (#27) — the grounding experiment (2026-07-02)

Research motivation (see `algorithm-review-2026-07.md`): Active Task Disambiguation (ICLR 2025,
arXiv:2502.04485) + ClarifyGPT — score questions by how they SPLIT a sampled set of viable
solutions rather than by an abstract 0-1 change judgment. #27: `value_judge_mode=solution` — K=4
candidate solutions sampled once per run (baseline reused as S1), judge returns which solutions
remain viable per answer, `delta_plan = invalidated/K`. Gated via `validate_evsi --ab-solution`
(re-judge the SAME records, realized shared).

**Setup:** powered n=12 REALIZED_SUBSET, all-`fast` pinned, stated P (#26 had just closed), 432
rows / 216 shared pairs / 72 questions, 21 min wall. Raw: `~/.hermes/evsi_solution_ab.json`.

**VERDICT — #27 CLOSED, KEEP ABSOLUTE (decisively worse, not a mere null).**

| target | absolute mean ρ | solution mean ρ | paired Δρ (sol−abs) | wins | gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| realized_regret (PRIMARY) | +0.360 | **−0.047** | **−0.343** (sd 0.51, se 0.16) | 3/10 | keep absolute |
| realized_stakes | +0.249 | −0.169 | −0.339 (sd 0.52, se 0.16) | 3/10 | keep absolute |
| realized_change | +0.297 | +0.023 | — | — | — |

- **The accepted caveat was the failure mode:** solution-set collapse. 69% of solution deltas are
  exactly 0 ("no solution invalidated") and most of the rest land at 1.0 — support ≈
  {0: 149, ¼: 10, ½: 8, ¾: 2, 1: 45}. Near-binary Δplan zeroes EVSI for most questions and
  destroys within-task ordering, even though the arms genuinely diverged (90% of pairs shifted
  Δplan by >0.05). Also observed: some prompts ran with K=3 (a sampled solution occasionally fails
  to parse; the set shrinks by design).
- **Interpretation:** with a small sampled solution set and a strict "survives unchanged" viability
  judge, most clarifying answers invalidate either nothing or everything. ATD's solution-space
  signal needs either many more solutions (cost) or graded viability (which reintroduces exactly
  the absolute-judgment fragility it was meant to replace). The absolute judge carries strictly
  more within-task signal in this domain.
- **Consistency check across the day's two runs:** absolute-arm regret ρ = +0.360 here vs +0.356 in
  the #26 run — the within-task baseline is stable across instruments and runs.

Solution stays built + off (`--value-judge-mode solution` for re-testing). Do not iterate on K or
judge leniency without a new hypothesis for the mass-at-zero problem.

## Deepseek re-adjudication (2026-07-03) — instrument-robustness of #26/#27 + assertion audit

Motivation: the #26/#27 powered runs were all-`fast` (cloud outage), and a deepseek-v4-pro
adversarial audit of the program's assertions (`~/.hermes/assertion_critique_ds.md`) named the
same-class-instrument confound as the central threat: "you tested whether a weak model can detect
improvements made by a weak model; the ρ≈0.35 ceiling is exactly a judge noise floor." Cloud
returned; jim directed a full re-adjudication under deepseek (now the default judge everywhere —
the fast pins were the outage workaround, `rejudge.py`'s default flipped to match). Runs:
`~/.hermes/evsi_probs_ab_ds.json` (#26: gen fast, elicit+judge deepseek),
`~/.hermes/evsi_solution_ab_ds.json` (#27: ALL-deepseek incl. solution sampling — the critique's
exact rescue scenario), plus an 80-row same-response rejudge (`rejudge_probs_ds.json`).

- **#26 HOLDS — keep `stated`.** Sampled Δρ +0.058 (se 0.11), wins 5/12 losses 4 — a slightly
  friendlier null than fast's +0.010, still nowhere near the broad-win gate. The calibration
  critique doesn't transfer even with a deep judge.
- **#27 HOLDS, STRENGTHENED — keep `absolute`.** Δρ **−0.369**, solution wins 1/10 (fast run:
  −0.343, 3/10). Decisive detail: deepseek sampling DID partially fix the granularity —
  mass-at-exactly-0 fell 69%→53% and the delta support fills all five K=4 values — and the method
  got *worse anyway*. The collapse critique ("fast can't sample diverse solutions") was tested on
  its own terms and falsified: the failure is inherent to the K-solutions framing, and the verdict
  is now model-robust.
- **The ρ ceiling is NOT judge noise (A9 falsified).** The audit's own test: strong judge + weak
  generator → ρ jumping above 0.5 would prove the ceiling was instrument noise. Result: within-task
  ρ under deepseek is +0.244–0.352 (regret), right in the fast band. Same-response instrument
  agreement fast↔deepseek ρ **0.814**; q_value's link to realized change moves only 0.353→0.398.
  The within-task ceiling lives in the task/data, not the judge.
- **Formula: best-or-tied on every dataset, never beaten.** #26-ds regret ablation: √(U·EVSI) best
  (+0.244, mean-Δ +0.242 statistically tied). #27-ds: three-way tie at the top (stakes-only +0.362,
  mean-Δ +0.357, √(U·EVSI) +0.352 — spread ≪ se). Honest cross-dataset claim after six powered
  datasets: **√(U·EVSI) is best or within noise of best everywhere and is never decisively beaten**;
  its edge over close ablations (mean-Δ) is inside noise, its edge over the bad ones (max-Δ,
  EVSI-only, U-only) is large. The freeze stands.
- **CI 4/4 under the deepseek judge** — including historically-flaky usaw-calendar, and
  reverse-string at 1.0 on every criterion with the correct empty bucket (the 1.2.1 fixes hold
  under the strong instrument).
- **Audit hits absorbed:** (A8) "U is inert for ranking" is stale — measured ρ(U-only vs full
  ordering) is 0.353 (fast data) / 0.496 (deepseek data): U materially reshapes the ranking, and
  since the full formula out-ranks U-only, it's earning its place, not overparameterized. (M3)
  per-category ρ is unstable across instruments (email +0.45 fast → −0.26 deepseek at n≈2
  prompts/cat) — no category conclusion is possible either way at this n; noted as a caveat.
- **Open assumptions the audit fairly flags (documented, not built):** utility-weighted lookahead
  was never tested head-to-head by us (A1); no human ground truth behind realized-regret (A2/A10);
  the gate vs a trivial always-inject-premortem baseline (A5); the empty-bucket bypass could mask a
  wrongly-empty bucket on an underspecified prompt — mitigated by `calibration` + the structural
  bucket-size expectation, unproven beyond the CI cases (A6); the preflight catches unusable
  judges, not subtly-random ones — a discrimination preflight is the natural extension (A7);
  additivity of question value (M2). Candidate falsifying tests are in the critique file.

## Objective-outcome validation (P3-P6, 2026-07-03) — the first ground-truth eval, and it bit

Everything above validates against an LLM-judged proxy. This section is the first **objective**
tier: `evals/outcome_bank.py` (20 ambiguous-but-executable tasks, hidden specs + hidden tests,
each verified against a reference implementation; the ClarifyGPT/AmbigSWE recipe) +
`evals/outcome_eval.py` (STRICT user simulator per arXiv:2606.03135 — answers only what the
hidden spec resolves; generic fishing gets "The spec doesn't say" — sandboxed per-test runner,
paired arms, exact sign test). All-deepseek, K=3. Raw: `~/.hermes/outcome_full.json` (+ pilots).

| arm | Δpass vs baseline | wins/losses (n=20) | sign p | unanswerable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| zeroshot (one naive call for K questions) | **+0.317** | 10/0 | **0.002** | 32% |
| nbq-derive (skill, `--auto-derive on`) | +0.183 | 5/0 | 0.0625 | 44% |
| prompt-evsi (whole framework in one prompt) | +0.117 | 5/1 | 0.22 | 45% |
| nbq (skill, plain) | +0.067 | 3/1 | 0.63 | **82%** |

**Verdicts (pre-registered):**
- **P3 CONFIRMED — clarification objectively improves artifacts** (zeroshot +0.317, p=0.002: the
  project's first statistically significant objective result). The purpose is real.
- **P4 FAILED, loudly — the machinery is out-asked by a naive baseline in this domain.** Not
  "≈ zeroshot" (the pre-registered worry) but decisively behind it. Mechanism (found in the
  pilot, confirmed in the full run's 82% unanswerable rate): **Δplan is judged as
  plan/text-volume change, not outcome change** — "should sorting be case-insensitive?" (a
  one-token fix that flips every output) scored 0.21 and was gated, while "what if the list has
  non-strings?" (validation boilerplate that changes nothing the tests measure) ranked top-3.
  The skill burns its K-question budget on robustness/scale/edge questions no spec answers.
  **realized_change/regret shares this lens** (it also measures response diff), which is why six
  proxy-validated datasets never caught it — the projection and the proxy are blind in the same
  direction (the assertion-audit's A10, demonstrated mechanically).
- **Derive-or-ask is the standout (Part A vindicated end-to-end):** +0.067 → **+0.183** (5W/0L,
  p=0.0625) and unanswerable 82% → 44%, i.e. it nearly triples the plain skill's benefit by
  converting derivable/knowledge questions to evidence — freeing bucket slots for real questions
  and feeding the derived facts to the solver.
- **prompt-evsi (the prompt-vs-script question): the pilot's perfect score was small-n flattery.**
  At n=20 the framework-in-one-prompt slightly beats the script (+0.117 vs +0.067) and trails
  plain zeroshot — the framework's stakes/derive emphasis steers questions to the same wrong
  altitude as the script's judge. Neither prompt-carried nor script-carried EVSI beats naive
  asking HERE; the script's structure is not the bottleneck — the VALUE MODEL is.
- **P6 QUALIFIED PASS:** Spearman(mean asked q_value, objective Δpass) = **+0.432** (n=20) — above
  the pre-registered 0.3 keep-line, so realized-regret retains standing as a gate target, with
  the volume-bias caveat now permanently attached.

- **P5 (over-asking): no penalty detected; benefit saturates at K≈1.** K-curve on the 8
  discriminating tasks (zeroshot arm): K=1 pass 0.792 · K=3 0.833 · K=5 0.792 · K=7 0.833 —
  while unanswerable noise climbs 25%→64%. The arXiv:2606.03135 context-pollution collapse does
  NOT appear in this range/domain (a strong solver tolerates "spec doesn't say"); the binding
  scarcity is asking the right FIRST question, which is exactly where the volume-biased judge
  currently mis-spends the slot. Raw: `~/.hermes/outcome_k{1,5,7}.json`.

**Domain caveat, stated honestly both ways:** micro-function tasks sit below the skill's
calibrated altitude (agentic multi-step work), and ~half the bank ties at baseline (a strong
solver guesses conventions). But the volume-bias mechanism is domain-general in kind — one-word
answers that flip everything exist in agentic tasks too ("prod or staging?") — and its magnitude
there is UNMEASURABLE by the realized proxy (shared blindness). Hence:

**→ #28 (queued, off-default, objectively gateable): outcome-semantic Δplan judge** — elicit
"how much would this answer change the BEHAVIOR/OUTPUT of the result" instead of "how much does
the plan change". First experiment in the program whose gate can be an objective outcome
(this harness) rather than the judged proxy.

### #28 gate verdict (2026-07-03, same day): NO ADOPT — partial positive below the bar

Run: 28 tasks (20 micro + 8 agentic, the #31 tier) × {baseline, nbq, nbq-behavior,
nbq-derive-behavior, zeroshot}, K=3, all-deepseek (`~/.hermes/outcome_28.json`); proxy sanity
n=12 behavior-elicited realized run (`evsi_behavior_sanity.json`).

| arm (combined n=28) | Δpass vs baseline | unanswerable |
|---|---|---|
| zeroshot | +0.327 (16W/0L) | 30% |
| nbq-behavior | +0.170 (8W/1L) | 65% |
| nbq-derive-behavior | +0.145 (10W/1L) | 52% |
| nbq | +0.105 (6W/0L) | 76% |

Pre-registered rule, applied mechanically: (1) paired nbq-behavior vs nbq = **+0.064, 6W/5L** —
fails the wins ≥ 2×losses guard; (2) unanswerable 65% > the ~60% bar; (3) proxy sanity ρ +0.204
✓ (just above the ≥~0.2 floor; expectedly weaker than absolute's +0.244 — the proxy measures
response-diff, which behavior-Δ deliberately diverges from). **Verdict: keep `absolute` as the
default; behavior stays built + off** (`--value-judge-mode behavior`). The honest reading is a
directional but insufficient win: on the agentic home turf behavior nearly TRIPLED the skill's
benefit (+0.077→+0.219) and cut waste (82%→65-67% unanswerable), but zeroshot beat even
nbq-behavior by +0.157 (9W/1L) — so the value model was only PART of P4's gap. The remainder is
generation altitude: even at home, the machinery's candidates skew away from the first-order
unknowns a naive ask surfaces. The agentic tier did NOT rescue the machinery (nbq unanswerable
was 88% there; zeroshot +0.394). #30's re-open condition (unanswerable >50% despite a #28 win)
is moot as registered — #28 didn't win — but the altitude finding is the real successor
hypothesis: the next lever is GENERATION (ask-the-first-order-question exposure), not judging.

## First-order candidate source (#32) — the generation-altitude test, cost-aware (2026-07-04)

The direct test of the #28 successor hypothesis ("the next lever is GENERATION, not judging"):
inject one naive "K best clarifying questions" call as round-1 candidates (`--firstorder on`, lens
`firstorder`), scored by the frozen pipeline. First experiment gated on **cost alongside Δresult**.

**Pre-registered ADOPT rule (quoted verbatim):** *"ADOPT iff: paired nbq-firstorder vs nbq Δpass
> 0 with wins ≥ 2×losses; unanswerable ≤ 50%; no regression on lens-payoff tasks (json-migrate's
.bak class); efficiency budget: the firstorder source adds 1 call ≈ ≤400 output tokens/run — adopt
requires mean added wall ≤ 10% of an nbq run. If ranking demotes the first-order candidates, deliver
the per-stage autopsy (their P/Δ/stakes vs survivors') — the diagnosis is the product on that
branch."*

**Gate (objective outcome harness, n=34 = 20 micro + 14 agentic, K=3, all-deepseek,

Spearman(q_value, Δpass)=0.214.

**Verdict: NO ADOPT** — mechanically, on the paired nbq-firstorder-vs-nbq comparison (n=34): Δpass
**+0.049 > 0** ✓ but **6W/6L/22-tie**, so wins ≥ 2×losses **fails** (broad-win guard); **unanswerable
77%** ✗ (> 50%); **lens-payoff regression** ✗ (`log-clean` 0.67→0.33 even as `json-migrate`
0.25→0.75 — net wash); **efficiency +16.8% wall / +18% tokens / +7 calls** ✗ (> 10% ceiling). Any one
of these is decisive; all four fail.

**Autopsy / diagnosis (the product):** altitude has real signal — the first-order arm's mean beats
plain nbq (+0.132 vs +0.083 over baseline) — but injecting first-order candidates into the EVSI
pipeline **does not close the P4 gap**: zeroshot still dominates at ~1/5 the wall and ~1/150 the
tokens, and the first-order arm's unanswerable rate *rose* (78% vs nbq 74%). The naive questions
fish more, so the strict simulator resolves fewer — the pipeline's answerability handling, not
candidate altitude, is the residual gap. This satisfies **#30's re-open condition** (unanswerable
> 50%), now the successor lever, with the standing constraint that the mechanism must not be
self-rated. `firstorder` stays built, off-by-default. Cost columns are now standing gate output.

## Answerability retro probe (#30 gate) — PARK (iteration two, 2026-07-04)

The first real *use* of `nbq-improve` as a protocol (iteration two) ran a **conditional full lap**:
a zero-cost retro probe (item A) gated whether to build #30 answerability weighting (item B).
Pre-registration: `nbq-improve/references/prereg-iteration-two.md`.

**Item A — retro probe, ZERO new model calls.** The originally-planned join against `relentless`'s
`journey.json` was not runnable (those logs carry no nbq assume-default annotations — the unbuilt
candidate 2). The cheapest falsifying test lived in the OBJECTIVE harness output instead:
`~/.hermes/outcome_eval_32.json` already carries, per task/arm, `meta.q_values[i]` (per-question
EVSI, index-aligned), `qa[i].revealed`/`answer` (answerability — "The spec doesn't say." ⇒
unanswerable), and `frac`/`per_test` (objective outcome). Probe: `evals/probe_answerability.py`
(offline, deterministic, stdlib-only); pinned input `~/.hermes/outcome_eval_32_iter2probe.json`
(sha256 3787b1f7…); durable stats `~/.hermes/probe_answerability_iter2.json`.

**Pre-registered GATE rule (verbatim):** "#30 build PROCEEDS iff the primary association is in the
hypothesized direction (unanswerable ⇒ more failure) AND the effect clears its own SE (|effect| > SE),
on ≥1 of the two primary framings, AND the marginal cells are not degenerate (both levels of the
predictor occur on ≥ ~15% of tasks). #30 is PARKED if: no association, wrong-direction association
(unanswerable ⇒ success), OR a degenerate predictor."

**Result (n=34 nbq tasks):**
- `top1_unans × fail` (highest-EVSI kept question unanswerable × frac<1): **r=+0.0516, SE=0.1765,
  |r| does NOT clear SE** → no-association. Contingency 18/7/6/3, base rate 0.735 (non-degenerate).
- `any_unans × fail`: **r=−0.1124 (wrong direction), base rate 0.971 → DEGENERATE** (33/34 tasks have
  ≥1 unanswerable top-K question — the predictor is near-constant, so the retro sample structurally
  cannot discriminate). Contingency 23/10/1/0.
- Tertiary `n_unans × frac`: r=−0.219 (weakly the hypothesized direction, but continuous and not a
  pre-registered decisive framing — the only whiff of signal, too underpowered to justify a build).

**Verdict: PARK.** Neither primary framing clears the mechanical gate. The φ-coefficients were
independently re-derived by hand from the contingency tables (12/√54000=+0.0516; −10/√7920=−0.1124).

**Autopsy / the product:** answerability's causal link to objective failure is **not supported** in
this corpus, and the probe explains *why a retro test here is weak*: unanswerability is near-universal
(73–97% base rate), so there is almost no answerable-question contrast to correlate against.
Down-weighting EVSI by answerability can only help if answerable high-value questions actually exist
to steer toward; on this task set they barely do. **A proper #30 test needs a higher-contrast corpus**
— which is exactly candidate 2 (nbq→relentless integration, to build a real annotated corpus) or
candidate 3 (reach→investigate loop, which *resolves* some unanswerables into answerables). #30 stays
parked; those rise.

**Item B (#30 answerability weighting) was NOT built** — the conditional gate was honored in commit
order, not retrofitted. Its pre-registration stands unexercised for a future lap, including the
**per-dimension efficiency ceilings** authored this lap (a bust on ANY axis vetoes even a result win):
"wall: mean added wall ≤ 10% of an nbq run; tokens: mean added tokens ≤ 15% of an nbq run; calls:
≤ +1 added model call per run (a second probe call is itself a veto)." Cost is no longer a single
scalar — `verdict-rubric.md` was sharpened to require a per-axis ceiling (wall, tokens, calls), the
methodology product of this lap.

## Reach→investigate arm (candidate 3, mocked) — NO ADOPT (iteration three, 2026-07-04)

Iteration three tested candidate 3: does resolving strict-unanswerable questions via a fixture-aware
mock investigator (observable state, not spec-only) lift objective pass AND create the
answerability↔pass contrast #30 needs? Pre-reg: `nbq-improve/references/prereg-iteration-three.md`.
Built an opt-in `nbq-reach-investigate` arm in `outcome_eval.py` (leakage-guarded — the mock never
sees the test oracle; validated at build time on a crafted observable question → resolved
`postgres://cfg` from a fixture). Gate: agentic bank n=14, K=3, all-deepseek, `--strict-preflight`,
930.9s. Durable: `~/.hermes/outcome_eval_iter3.json`.

**The load-bearing number: 0 investigator resolutions across all 42 rows.** The mock never fired once
— not because it is broken (the build smoke proved it resolves observable questions), but because
**none of nbq's kept high-EVSI questions were observably resolvable.**

**Pre-registered ADOPT rule (verbatim):** "Adopt the arm as a standing corpus-builder instrument …
exactly when: Δpass > 0 with wins ≥ 2× losses AND unanswerable materially down AND zero oracle
leakage." **Result: FAIL** — unanswerable did NOT drop, it *rose* (nbq 78.6% → reach 81.0%, +2.4pts),
and resolutions = 0 make "unanswerable down" impossible. **Verdict: NO ADOPT / candidate 3 PARKED.**

**The apparent Δpass is an artifact, not the mechanism.** Arm means: baseline 0.351, nbq 0.301,
reach 0.401 (naive paired reach−nbq = +0.100, 6W/1L/7-tie, p=0.125). But **0/14 tasks asked identical
questions across the two arms** — each arm runs its own independent stochastic question-generation
call, so with 0 resolutions the reach arm is simply a *second, unpaired nbq draw*. The +0.100 is
question-sampling variance, not a treatment effect (the treatment never occurred). #30 does NOT
un-park: the probe on both arms is uninformative here anyway (all 14 tasks scored frac<1.0, so the
`fail` outcome has zero variance → r=0.000 on every fail-framing).

**The real product — why the answerability lever keeps failing (intent vs state):** nbq's kept
high-EVSI questions are about **intent** — "what level of detail is expected?", "which schema?",
"crash or fall back when the key is missing?" An investigator hop can observe **state** (files, env,
config) but cannot observe **intent** (what the user *wants*). So resolving-from-observables
structurally cannot touch the valuable questions. This is the same reason #30 answerability weighting
parked in iteration two: the unanswerable questions are unanswerable *because they encode
user-specific intent*, and those are precisely the most valuable clarifications — down-weighting them
by answerability would down-weight the value. **The answerability/reachability lever looks like a
dead-end for this task class; the value is IN the intent questions, and intent is answerable only by
the user (candidate 2, nbq→relentless, where a real user answers), not by a vantage or a hop.**

**Methodology banked (gate-validity):** an answering-side mechanism must be tested with the
control and treatment sharing the SAME generated questions (vary only the answering). Two arms that
each re-generate questions are UNPAIRED; their frac delta confounds the mechanism with
question-sampling variance and cannot be read as a treatment effect. Added to `verdict-rubric.md`.
Re-open candidate 3 only with (a) a shared-question paired design AND (b) the reach lens forced on —
but the intent/state finding predicts limited upside.

## Answer-vs-assume paired ablation (candidate 2 premise-test) — ATTRIBUTION FAIL (iteration four, 2026-07-11)

Iteration four ran the cheap single-shot premise-test of candidate 2 (route intent questions to
whoever holds the intent): does giving the solver the ORACLE's real answer to nbq's top-K questions
beat giving it nbq's own ASSUMED default (`modal_answer`), holding the question set fixed — with an
`answer-lowevsi` attribution control (oracle-answer the low-value `all_scored` tail instead) guarding
the oracle-leakage tautology. Pre-reg: `nbq-improve/references/prereg-iteration-four.md` (committed
BEFORE the build, `823e12786`). Four arms share ONE `infogain.run` question set per task —
the iter-three paired-design lesson, now *enforced in-run* (`assert_paired_design`, fail-closed);
matched injection phrasing (all arms route through the same `solve_prompt`; only answer content
differs, pinned by test).

**Stage-0 pre-check (read-only, zero model calls, ran FIRST):** combined 23/48 = 0.479 tasks with ≥1
revealed top-K question ≥ the pre-registered ⅓ threshold ⇒ **GO** (micro32 19/34 = 0.559; iter3
4/14 = 0.286). `evals/stage0_precheck.py`; durable `~/.hermes/stage0_precheck_iter4.json`.

**Gate:** n=34 (both banks), K=3, all-deepseek (`deepseek-v4-pro:cloud`), `--strict-preflight`,
1600.1s, 0 errors, `paired_design_valid: true`, `modal_answer` coverage 102/102. Durable:
`~/.hermes/outcome_eval_iter4.json`; analysis `~/.hermes/analyze_ablation_iter4.json`
(`evals/analyze_ablation.py` applies the staged rule mechanically).

**Pre-registered staged rule (verbatim):** "PROCEED to Stage 2 (the expensive relentless A/B — a
FUTURE lap) iff BOTH primary conditions hold: Δpass(answer − assume) > 0 AND
Δpass(answer − answer-lowevsi) > 0, each with wins ≥ 2× losses AND mean-clears-SE. … answer beats
assume but NOT answer-lowevsi → attribution FAILS. Answering helps, but nbq's ranking doesn't pick
better questions than the tail. That is an nbq-value finding (log it); it does NOT greenlight the
expensive build — it re-opens the ranker, not candidate 2's integration."

**Result — primary 1 PASSES, primary 2 FAILS ⇒ verdict: ATTRIBUTION_FAIL.**

- Δpass(answer − assume) = **+0.093** (9W/3L/22T, SE 0.052, mean clears SE, broad win, sign_p 0.146)
  — real answers beat nbq's own guessed defaults. The first objective evidence on this substrate that
  ANSWERING beats ASSUMING at all.
- Δpass(answer − answer-lowevsi) = **−0.024** (6W/9L/19T, SE 0.063, fails everything) — answering
  nbq's top-K did NOT beat answering the low-value tail. Arm means vs baseline 0.396: assume 0.462
  (Δ+0.066, 8W/8L — assuming defaults doesn't clearly help), answer 0.555 (Δ+0.159, 9W/2L, p=0.065),
  answer-lowevsi 0.578 (Δ+0.182, 12W/4L, p=0.077) — the pre-registered near-tautology realized:
  *any* spec answer helps.
- Clean-contrast subset (answer revealed ≥1, n=14): answer−assume +0.116 (5W/2L, clears SE, broad);
  answer−lowevsi +0.001 (3W/3L) — same shape.
- **EVSI-validation product (journaled regardless, per prereg):** per-task correlation of predicted
  value with realized Δ(answer−assume) is **negative** — ρ(value) = −0.204, ρ(evsi) = −0.229 (n=34).
  Pre-registered caveat applies: this partly recovers nbq's own calibration; the attribution control
  carries the external test — which failed.

**The mechanism behind the attribution failure (the real finding):** the oracle revealed only
**19%** (19/102) of nbq's top-K questions vs **33%** (34/102) of the low-value tail. nbq's ranking
preferentially selects **intent** questions — which the strict spec-bound oracle refuses — so the
`answer` arm mostly injected refusals while the tail arm injected more real spec content. This is
laps 1–3's intent-vs-state finding, now measured from the answering side. Two readings, both true:
(a) mechanically, the pre-registered rule fails — on this substrate nbq's ranking adds no measurable
answer-value over the tail; (b) structurally, a hidden-spec oracle **cannot reward intent questions**
(the spec rarely encodes intent), so this substrate cannot attribute nbq's value even when powered on
reveal counts — it can only reward spec-answerable trivia. The substrate saturation suspected in the
pre-reg's open unknowns is now measured, not just suspected.

**Per-axis cost (4-arm shared-question run, n=34):** wall 1600s total (mean/task: baseline 3.3s,
assume 4.7s, answer 6.5s, answer-lowevsi 6.3s — assume adds ZERO model calls beyond the shared
generation); tokens 23.3k/task and 42.5 calls/task dominated by the single shared generation
(reported once per task, not 4×: the shared design makes the 4-arm run ≈ the cost of one nbq arm +
K oracle calls per answering arm).

**Disposition:** Stage 2 (the relentless A/B) is **NOT greenlit** — the staged gate is honored in
commit order (this verdict recorded before any Stage-2 decision). The arm code ships as a standing
opt-in eval instrument (`--paired-ablation`; existing arms byte-identical; suite 217→226). Forward
route: (1) the ranker question is logged but is **unanswerable on this substrate** (an oracle that
refuses intent cannot rank intent-askers above trivia-askers); (2) the **relentless headroom
diagnostic** (confirm high-EVSI intent questions get `via:"assumed"` in live relentless runs) remains
the candidate-2 route — candidate 2 is neither proven nor killed by this lap.

### Retro addendum (post-hoc, hypothesis-generating — not pre-registered)

Zero-cost retro probes on the durable gate JSON (`~/.hermes/outcome_eval_iter4.json`; no model
calls), splitting the 34 tasks by whether the oracle revealed ≥1 of nbq's top-K questions
(14 revealed / 20 unrevealed):

- **Exposure-not-answers.** On the 20 tasks where the oracle revealed NOTHING, the `answer` arm
  injected pure refusals ("The spec doesn't say.") — and still beat baseline **+0.143** (5W/2L)
  and beat `assume` (4W/1L, +0.077). Real oracle content on top added little (+0.181 vs baseline
  on the revealed tasks). Surfacing nbq's top-K QUESTIONS as explicit unknowns appears to carry
  most of the single-shot value; the answers add little.
- **Modal defaults are a wash vs baseline** (+0.067, 4W/4L on both splits) and worse than
  admitting ignorance. Rough agreement between nbq's guessed default and the oracle's real answer
  on revealed top-K questions: ~1/19.
- **EVSI↔realized-Δ stays negative within both subsets** (ρ ≈ −0.23 revealed / −0.16 unrevealed)
  — the negative correlation is not purely refusal-mass.

Caveats: this is a post-hoc subgroup analysis conditioning on oracle behavior (selection effects
possible — reveal status is not randomized); small n; many ties. It changes NO verdict — the
pre-registered ATTRIBUTION_FAIL stands. Its role is to generate the iteration-five hypothesis:
a pre-registered `questions-only` arm (inject top-K questions as explicit "UNKNOWN — handle
sensibly", zero oracle calls) testing whether exposure alone reproduces the answer arm's gain.

**Thesis under test (recap, for a cold reader).** Candidate 2 is "route intent questions to whoever
holds the intent." Iteration four's cheap premise-test asked the single-shot version: holding the
question set fixed (ONE shared nbq generation per task), does giving the solver the ORACLE's real
answer to nbq's top-K questions (`answer` arm) beat giving it nbq's own guessed default
(`assume` arm)? The `answer-lowevsi` control — oracle-answer the low-value tail instead of the
top-K — guarded the "any spec answer helps" tautology: if the tail helps as much as the top-K, the
benefit is not attributable to nbq's *ranking*. That control fired (ATTRIBUTION_FAIL), because the
strict spec-oracle refuses the intent questions nbq preferentially ranks (revealed 19% of top-K vs
33% of the tail) — the substrate rewards spec-answerable trivia, not intent.

**What the retro adds (the learning).** The `answer` arm actually bundles TWO ingredients, and the
verdict couldn't separate them: (1) EXPOSURE — the solver is explicitly told these specific things
are unresolved; (2) CONTENT — the solver is handed the oracle's actual answer. Conditioning on
whether the oracle revealed anything decomposes them. On the 20 tasks where the oracle revealed
NOTHING, the only ingredient present was exposure (the top-K surfaced as literal "The spec doesn't
say." refusals) — and the arm STILL beat baseline +0.143 and beat `assume` +0.077. Adding real
oracle content on the revealed tasks lifted it only to +0.181. So **most of nbq's single-shot value
here is EXPOSURE, not ANSWERS**: turning implicit assumptions into explicit open questions the solver
must consciously handle is itself worth most of the gain, and it needs no oracle. That `assume`
(nbq's guessed modal default) is a wash vs baseline (+0.067) — and agrees with the oracle only ~1/19
of the time — says the *content* nbq can synthesize on its own is near-worthless here; the lever that
moves the outcome is naming the right unknowns.

**Why this matters to the program (the throughline).** This is laps 1–3's intent≠state finding,
now measured from the answering side and turned into a positive claim. Laps 1–3 established that
nbq's high-EVSI questions encode *intent* (which reading, crash-vs-fallback, level of detail),
unobservable by any state-hop and answerable only by the user — so answerability/reachability levers
(#30 weighting, reach→investigate) are dead ends because the value lives in the unobservable. The
retro sharpens that: even when intent goes UNanswered, surfacing it as an explicit unknown captures
most of the realized benefit. Two consequences. (a) It re-frames candidate 2's integration target:
the cheap, high-leverage move may be nbq-as-unknown-surfacer feeding the planner's open-questions
list, not nbq-as-question-router waiting on an oracle. (b) It sidesteps the substrate's structural
limit: a spec-oracle that refuses intent cannot score ANSWER quality, but the exposure hypothesis
needs no oracle at all, so it is measurable on this very harness. Iteration five pre-registers the
`questions-only` arm to test exposure head-on, and reshapes the headroom diagnostic to ask whether
live relentless SURFACES high-EVSI unknowns to the planner (renders them as explicit open questions),
not merely whether it silently marks them `via:"assumed"`.

## Caveats

- 3 independent prompt clusters; n=51/n=17 overstate power. The +0.394 leans on gtm-plan (dropping it
  → 0.243). Treat all magnitudes as directional.
- `realized_change` saturates (71% at 0/1) — coarse ground truth; the per-question aggregate is
  tie-free, but row-level rank signal is concentrated at the extremes.
- Projected scores use the shipped deepseek judge; `realized_change` uses a deepseek change-judge —
  not de-confounded from each other by model.
- **Domain scan:** 1 prompt/cell, fast generation + deepseek judge, the value distribution only (no
  realized_change). Some of the agentic downshift could be model-capability (the fast model projecting
  agentic answers less richly, à la usaw) rather than pure domain structure — but the U-spread /
  derivability pattern is structurally sensible (research tasks *are* more derivable), so it most likely
  reflects a real domain effect. The agentic *realized*-change calibration (per-regime) is the follow-up.
