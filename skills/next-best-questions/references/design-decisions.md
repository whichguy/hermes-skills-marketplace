# Design decisions — the "explore vs disregard" model

This note records the conceptual model the skill implements and the decisions behind it, so the
rationale lives with the code. See `methodology.md` for the academic grounding (EVSI/EIG).

## The decision the skill supports

Answering questions is **expensive**, so the real per-question decision is a meta-decision:
**explore it** (spend effort to answer it) or **disregard it** (skip it, proceed on your
assumption). The skill ranks questions by how much it's worth paying to answer them, top-down, so
you explore within budget and disregard the rest (carrying their default assumptions forward).

A question has a **variety of possible answers** (and "no answer / indeterminate" is just one of
those outcomes) — it is *not* binary true/false. We evaluate one layer deep: enumerate the answers,
score the question, done. We do **not** build a 2–3 step projected chain (question→answer→question…)
— that explodes combinatorially and compounds the model's projection error. The multi-step depth
comes from the **evidence loop** instead (below), grounded on real answers, not hypotheticals.

## The one quantity that matters: value of answering = cost of disregarding

These are the same number from opposite sides:

```
value of answering a question  =  cost of disregarding it
                               =  Σ over the variety of answers:  P(answer) × regret(default plan, answer)
```

i.e., for each way the answer could come out, how much you'd regret having acted on your default —
weighted by how likely that outcome is. This is the **EVSI** (Expected Value of Sample Information).

## Vocabulary (one name per quantity)

| term | meaning | range |
|---|---|---|
| **uncertainty** (`U`) | is the answer unknown *and* reducible? `entropy(answers) × (1 − derivable_prob)` | 0–1 |
| **value of answering** (`EVSI`) | regret you'd avoid, summed over the variety of answers (`Σ P·Δplan·stakes`) | 0–1 |
| **exploration value** (`value`) | the number you rank by | 0–1 |

## The formula

```
exploration value = √(uncertainty × value-of-answering)
```

= `√(U × EVSI)`. Properties:
- `value` is 0 if EITHER the uncertainty gate or the EVSI is 0 (the necessary-condition gate).
- The geometric mean keeps it on an interpretable ~0–1 scale, so absolute thresholds (0.40/0.60)
  are meaningful.
- **Risk-neutral** by default (probability-weighted). A risk-averse tilt (flag a catastrophic-but-
  unlikely branch even when improbable) is a deliberate future option, not the default.

> **Tried and removed: answerability.** An `answerability × …` multiplier (P a determinate answer is
> obtainable if explored) was added and then removed after a benchmark showed it inert — pinned at
> ~0.95 in 15/16 cells and reordering the ranking in 0/15 — because clarifying questions are almost
> always answerable. It added a field + prompt complexity for no measured effect.

> **Phase-1 validation (2026-06) — `U` inert, EVSI not-yet-validated.** The realized-vs-projected
> study (`evsi-validation-findings.md`) found: (a) the **Δ component is directionally calibrated**
> (per-answer ρ=0.39, cluster p=0.005); (b) **`U` is inert** — `√(U·EVSI)` ranks identically to
> EVSI-only (0/40 within-prompt reorderings) and `U`-alone is anti-predictive → candidate for removal;
> (c) the **full stakes-weighted EVSI is not-yet-validated**: it is null against the only clean signal
> (realized response-change, ρ=−0.009), and its apparent +0.605 "validation" is a **stakes-reuse
> confound** (the realized-EVSI target recycles projected stakes; partial-ρ\|stakes = −0.13);
> (d) **max-Δ** is the best clean-signal predictor but marginal (p=0.064). *Caveat:* n=17 / 3 prompts,
> and `U`'s range is compressed (0.725–0.984), so its inertness is unproven beyond this sample.
> **`U` has two roles** — it's inert as a *ranking* factor but **load-bearing as the gate**
> (`is_gated_out`: `derivable_prob`→1 → `U`→0 retires answered questions across rounds, §"evidence
> loop"); the ablation only tested the ranking role. So a future "drop U" means removing it from the
> `value` number **only**, never from the derivability gate.
> **Domain update — `U` is NOT inert in the target domain.** A 34-prompt/17-category scan
> (`evsi-validation-findings.md` §Domain sensitivity) shows the "U inert" result was a **life-domain
> artifact**: on agentic/tool/coding tasks U's spread is **0.26 (vs 0.07)** and it is the
> **ask-the-user vs go-find-out discriminator** (via `derivable_prob` — high derivable → U→0 → route to
> research, the Phase-2 trigger). So **`U` stays.** The domain looked like it broke the absolute thresholds
> (61% of agentic candidates fall below the life-tuned 0.40) — but the later realized-improvement scan
> (`evsi-validation-findings.md` §Stop + breadth calibration) showed most of those 61% are *genuinely*
> low-value (realized improvement ~0.15 below value ~0.30), so the fix was **calibrating the absolute
> floor (0.40 → 0.30)**, not going relative. The rank-relative mechanism (`rel_keep_frac`) is built but
> stays **off**.
> **Decision (2026-06): the formula is FROZEN** — no changes on n=17. A de-confounded, **agentic**,
> per-regime re-run (#21) that measures realized *stakes* and registers max-Δ as a competitor decides
> every formula question; the wrapper build is gated on it.

## The evidence loop (how multi-step depth happens)

The skill is a **stateless, report-only primitive**. To iterate:
1. Run → get ranked questions.
2. You / the Hermes agent go answer the top ones and bring back **real evidence**.
3. Re-run with that evidence folded into the same problem context → the next-best questions.
4. Repeat until the bucket comes back empty (well-specified).

Mechanically, `--evidence` facts are woven into three stages: **framing** (the baseline plan reflects
what's known), **generation** (don't re-ask the resolved), and **answer-projection** (resolved
questions read as derivable → `U → 0` → they drop out automatically). The convergence is free: the
scoring retires answered questions and promotes the next tier. The answering and the looping live
**outside** the skill, where the caller put them.

## Comparative elicitation (#24) — built, off by default, A/B-gated

The one *measured* weakness is **within-task ranking** (per-prompt Spearman ρ≈0.34): given one task's
candidate questions, the top-ranked isn't reliably the most valuable. The likely cause is the same
fragility that collapsed the realized-stakes instrument — **absolute 0-1 Δ/stakes elicitation**, which
models do poorly. The fix is **comparative elicitation**: ask forced-choice comparisons ("which answer
changes the response more?", which models do well) and aggregate them, instead of scoring each answer
in isolation.

This is built as an **off-by-default, A/B-gated experiment** so it can only ever *help*, never regress
the live skill:

- **`scripts/pairwise.py`** (pure, tested) — Bradley-Terry MLE (phantom-regularized) + win-count
  fallback + anchored [0,1] mapping. The subtle part is preserving **between-task** scale (the
  validated ρ≈0.66): two virtual ANCHOR items — `FLOOR` ("no change") → 0 and `CEILING` ("completely
  different") → 1 — sit in *every* question's comparison set, so a question whose answers merely tie
  FLOOR lands near 0 (low EVSI) while a high-impact question's answers land high. Pairwise fixes the
  within-question ordering without flattening cross-question magnitude.
- **`pipeline.judge_plan_change_pairwise[_batch]`** — same contract as the absolute judge (writes the
  same per-answer `delta_plan`/`stakes` that `voi.evsi`/`score_record` read), so it's a drop-in. Two
  model calls/question (change, stakes); safe-zeroes on any parse failure.
- **Selector** — `value_judge_mode` ("absolute" | "pairwise", default **"absolute"**), special-cased
  like `--mode`; absent key → "absolute", so every cfg built from DEFAULTS is byte-identical. One call
  site branches (`infogain.run`).
- **The gate** — `validate_evsi --ab` scores BOTH methods on the SAME question/answer set (realized
  measured once, shared); `analyze_evsi` prints each method's within-task mean ρ. **Pairwise becomes
  the default ONLY if it measurably beats absolute** (Δρ > 0.02 on realized_change / realized_regret);
  otherwise absolute (validated) is untouched.
- **A/B verdict (2026-06): #24 CLOSED — KEEP ABSOLUTE (powered null).** Powered 12-prompt A/B on the
  corrected metric (gate ranks on **`realized_regret`** = realized EVSI, with a per-prompt paired-Δρ
  broad-win guard): pairwise is **slightly worse** on every realized target (regret abs +0.360 vs pw
  +0.204; loses 9/12 prompts) — comparative elicitation does **not** help projected Δ/stakes. Pairwise
  stays built + off as a documented negative result; the de-saturated realized judge is **NOT built**
  (pointless — pairwise doesn't even help on projected). *The n=6 sub-narratives ("realized_change is
  within-task-dead", "pairwise +0.07 edge", "saturation", "stakes is the unique signal") were all
  SMALL-SAMPLE NOISE* — at n=12 realized_change is +0.30 and pairwise is −0.02; the binding limit was
  power, exactly as the adversarial check predicted. **Strong positive:** the `p1c` ablation vs
  realized_regret ranks `√(U·EVSI)` **best (+0.360)** above every component (U-only +0.264, EVSI-only
  +0.202, stakes-only +0.157, max-Δ +0.075) → within-task ranking is modest-but-real (ρ≈0.36) and the
  frozen formula is validated within-task, not just between-regime. See `evsi-validation-findings.md`
  §"Comparative elicitation (#24)".

## Sampled P(a) (#26) — built, off by default, A/B-gated

The 2024-26 literature converges on one critique of rankers like ours: the load-bearing numbers are
**LLM self-reported**, and LLM probabilities are poorly calibrated — BED-LLM (arXiv:2508.21184) shows
Monte-Carlo EIG from *sampled* answer rollouts materially beats LLM-scored/entropy proxies; OPEN
(arXiv:2403.05534) offloads probability estimation from the LLM for the same reason. That maps
directly onto our one measured weakness (within-task ranking, ρ≈0.34-0.36) — so #26 replaces the
projection call's stated `P(a)` with an **empirical forced-choice frequency**, gated exactly like #24:

- **Cheap hybrid, not free-form rollouts.** The projection call is unchanged (it still enumerates the
  answer support + `derivable_prob`). Then N (default 6) tiny forced-choice draws — options shuffled
  per draw to kill position bias, temperature 1.0, ~16 output tokens, "reply with the option number"
  — and Laplace-smoothed (α=0.5) frequencies become `P(a)`. This tests the calibration claim at ~1/7
  the cost of free-form sampling and avoids fragile free-text→option mapping on local models.
- **Stated probs survive** as `stated_prob` (the control arm and the fallback: < ⌈N/2⌉ parseable
  draws → keep stated, tag `prob_mode_used="stated-fallback"`). `voi.py` reads the same `prob` field
  — the frozen formula is untouched; only the input estimate changes.
- **Selector** — `answer_prob_mode` ("stated" | "sampled", default **"stated"**), special-cased like
  `value_judge_mode`; absent key → "stated", so every cfg built from DEFAULTS is byte-identical.
  Knobs `answer_samples` / `answer_sample_temperature` in DEFAULTS. One branch at the projection
  seam (`infogain.run`).
- **The gate** — `validate_evsi --ab-probs`: the run samples, then the SAME records are re-scored
  under stated P (swap `prob`↔`stated_prob` + `voi.score_record` — zero extra model calls); realized
  is measured once over the union of each arm's top-N answers. `analyze_evsi`'s generalized A/B gate
  (control = `stated`) applies the #24 decisive rule: adopt only on a broad, beyond-noise Δρ > 0.02
  win on `realized_regret` at n=12.
- Smoke-verified: the arms genuinely diverge (11/14 pairs shift P by >0.05, 9/14 shift q_value).
- **A/B verdict (2026-07-02): #26 CLOSED — KEEP STATED (powered null).** Powered 12-prompt
  REALIZED_SUBSET A/B, all-`fast` pinned (judge/elicit/gen), 488 rows / 244 shared realized pairs:
  on the PRIMARY target `realized_regret`, Δρ mean **+0.010** (sd 0.39, se 0.11), sampled wins only
  4/12 — nowhere near the broad-win gate. Secondary `realized_stakes` +0.041 (7/12) also
  indecisive. The null is REAL, not a no-contrast artifact: the arms disagreed on 79% of pairs
  (|ΔP| > 0.05) and shifted q_value on 76% — a materially different P estimate that produced the
  same within-task discrimination. Conclusion mirrors #24: the binding weakness of within-task
  ranking is NOT input miscalibration of P(a); BED-LLM's calibration gains don't transfer to this
  utility-weighted, coarse-realized-target setting. Sampled stays built + off as a documented
  negative result. **Bonus replication:** the same run's p1c ablation ranks `√(U·EVSI)` best on ALL
  three realized targets (regret +0.356 ≈ the prior +0.360; stakes +0.266; change +0.325) — a
  second independent within-task validation of the frozen formula.
- **Re-confirmed under deepseek (2026-07-03):** same gate with deepseek elicitation + judging —
  Δρ +0.058, wins 5/12 → still keep `stated`. The null is instrument-robust (findings §Deepseek
  re-adjudication).

## Solution-space Δplan (#27) — built, off by default, A/B-gated

Second frontier critique (Active Task Disambiguation, arXiv:2502.04485; ClarifyGPT): score questions
by how they **split the viable solution set**, not by an abstract "how much would your response
change, 0-1?" judgment. #27 grounds `delta_plan` in a concrete self-consistency set:

- **Stage 0b, once per run** — `pipeline.sample_solutions`: K (default 4) candidate responses;
  solution 1 is the existing `baseline_plan` (free), K−1 sampled at temperature 0.8. Reused across
  ALL questions and rounds → +K−1 = 3 calls per run, the cheapest experiment yet.
- **Stage 3 variant** — `pipeline.judge_plan_change_solution[_batch]`: for each projected answer the
  judge returns which of the K numbered solutions remain viable if it's true; `delta_plan =
  invalidated/K` (plus `viable_solutions` as a diagnostic). Stakes elicitation unchanged. Same
  output fields → drop-in for `voi.score_record`, exactly like the pairwise judge; safe-zeroes on
  parse failure.
- **Selector** — `value_judge_mode="solution"` (a third choice on the #24 seam); knobs
  `solution_samples` / `solution_temperature`. `infogain.run` samples once after framing and binds
  the solution set via `functools.partial`.
- **Accepted caveat** — Δplan quantizes to {0, 1/K, …, 1} and a collapsed solution set (K
  near-identical responses) pushes it toward 0/1. Inherent to the framing; the gate decides whether
  grounding beats granularity.
- **The gate** — `validate_evsi --ab-solution` (re-judge the same records, realized shared;
  `--answer-prob-mode sampled` pins the #26 winner if adopted), same decisive rule, control =
  `absolute`.
- **A/B verdict (2026-07-02): #27 CLOSED — KEEP ABSOLUTE (powered, decisively worse).** Powered
  12-prompt REALIZED_SUBSET A/B, all-`fast` pinned, stated P (#26 closed first), 432 rows / 216
  shared pairs: solution Δplan within-task ρ on `realized_regret` is **−0.047 vs absolute +0.360**
  (paired Δρ **−0.343**, loses 7/10) and negative on stakes too (−0.169). The accepted-caveat
  failure mode is exactly what happened: the anticipated collapse — **69% of solution deltas are
  exactly 0** ("no solution invalidated") and most of the rest land at 1.0 (support ≈ {0: 149,
  1: 45}) — flattens Δplan to near-binary and destroys within-task discrimination, even though the
  arms diverged on 90% of pairs. Active Task Disambiguation's solution-space scoring does not
  survive contact with a small sampled solution set + a strict viability judge in this domain. The
  absolute 0-1 judge, for all its known fragility, carries strictly more within-task signal.
  Solution stays built + off as a documented negative result; do NOT iterate on K or judge leniency
  without a new hypothesis for the mass-at-zero problem.
- **Re-confirmed under ALL-deepseek (2026-07-03) — the "fast was too weak" rescue is falsified:**
  with deepseek doing solution sampling, viability judging AND realized judging, granularity
  partially recovers (mass-at-0 69%→53%, support fills {0,¼,½,¾,1}) and the method is WORSE:
  Δρ −0.369, wins 1/10. The collapse is inherent to the K-solutions framing, model-robustly
  (findings §Deepseek re-adjudication).

## Derive-or-ask — derivable questions become evidence, tested not trusted (1.3.0, 2026-07-03)

Jim's Bayesian reframe of the gate: the projected answer distribution is the model's posterior.
Peaked + derivable → **not a valid question — it's evidence wearing a question mark**; spread +
underivable → a valid question whose weight is the expected impact of resolving genuine ignorance.
Pre-1.3.0 the skill only *suppressed* the first class (`derivable→U→0→SKIP`): the answer was never
actually produced, never became evidence, and a *wrongly-inflated* derivability claim silently
killed a real question. Now every claim ≥ `derive_threshold` is **tested by an actual derivation
attempt** (`pipeline.attempt_derivation`): success → the answer is **tombstoned into the working
evidence** (the investigator's tombstone pattern; refill rounds re-plan against it and the
question retires naturally) and reported under "Resolved during analysis"; CANNOT_DERIVE → the
claim failed its experiment, `derivable_prob` is capped at `cannot_derive_cap` and the question
re-scored — it re-enters ranking honestly. A final-round derivation grants one bounded extra
refill round so fresh tombstones get exploited.

- **The derive prompt is knowledge-INCLUSIVE ("…or your own general knowledge") — load-bearing.**
  `derivable_prob`'s semantics are "asking adds nothing", which covers prompt facts, established
  facts, and parametric knowledge. Probe (2026-07-03): 22% of bank candidates claim derivable
  ≥0.8, largely knowledge-class (all 9 on research-ratelimit); a strict "from the prompt alone"
  wording makes those FAIL derivation, and the correction branch would re-inflate their U and
  flood buckets with questions the gate retires correctly today. Pinned by a test.
- **Derive model = value_judge_model (deepseek), not `fast`:** same probe — fast is over-strict on
  knowledge questions (CANNOT_DERIVE where deepseek correctly answers). Fabrication risk measured
  LOW: 0/12 fabrications across both models on user-only/tool-only questions (the escape works);
  visible provenance in the report is the remaining guard.
- **Hedges count as failed derivations** (`pipeline._HEDGE_RE`): the do-no-harm check caught fast
  tombstoning "The prompt does not specify whether …" as if it were an answer — a non-answer
  wearing an answer's clothes, i.e. junk evidence. Hedge phrasings (does not specify / not
  specified / insufficient information / …) now route to the CANNOT_DERIVE branch. Pinned in
  tests.
- **Default ON for the CLI; absent-key OFF** (the families/#26 byte-identical convention) so
  harness-built cfgs and the six powered eval datasets stay comparable. Rollback:
  `INFOGAIN_AUTO_DERIVE=off`. Not a #26 re-open: #26 tested *replacing* stated P(a) elicitation
  for ranking; this *reconciles* one stated input against a performed computation.
- **Known residual:** when the bucket early-stops in the same round as a derivation, that round's
  bucket was projected pre-tombstone (no later round re-plans). Bounded: any bucket member with a
  claim ≥ threshold was itself derive-tested pre-selection, so stale *derivable* stragglers can
  only exist below threshold. The report wording reflects this ("refill rounds re-plan against
  it").

## Behavior-Δ judge (#28) — built, off by default, the first OBJECTIVELY-gated experiment

The objective-outcome tier exposed the absolute judge's volume bias (Δplan read as text change:
one-token/output-flipping questions gated, boilerplate promoted — findings §Objective-outcome).
`value_judge_mode="behavior"` re-elicits Δplan as **behavior/outcome change of the delivered
result** ("consequence, not code size"; one-token flip ~1.0, robustness boilerplate ≤0.2) — same
JSON contract, `voi.py` untouched. **Gate verdict (2026-07-03): NO ADOPT** — paired vs absolute
on 28 objective tasks: +0.064 with 6W/5L (broad-win guard requires wins ≥ 2×losses); unanswerable
65% vs the ~60% bar; proxy sanity passed (ρ +0.204). Directionally right — on the agentic tier it
nearly tripled the skill's end-to-end benefit — but zeroshot still out-asked it by +0.157, so the
value model is only part of P4's gap; the remainder is generation altitude (successor hypothesis:
first-order-question exposure at GENERATION, not judging). Stays built for re-testing; the
objective harness is now the standing gate for any elicitation change.

## Reach lens (#29) — a fifth question family: reachable other points of view

Jim's framing: vantage asks "would the answer differ by where you look from?"; reach asks
**"does a DIFFERENT, REACHABLE point of view exist that would turn an unknown into an
observable — possibly via CHAINED hops (machine → machine → service)?"** It hunts the
answerability/derivability term no other lens hunts, and connects to derive-or-ask (derivability
is vantage-relative: CANNOT_DERIVE from here ≠ from inside the container). The ranker only
SURFACES reach questions; the investigator executes any actual hop. Directive requires naming
the hop chain, the access each hop needs, what the final vantage reveals, and the hop's
cost/risk (ASPI, arXiv:2605.17324: every hop widens the injection/trust surface).
- Mechanics mirror premortem exactly (one `_LENS_DIRECTIVE` entry + a gated `families_prompt`
  line + auto knob); the auto gate IS the vantage gate (`_reach_relevant = _vantage_relevant`) —
  same systems/access surface, no new false-positive list. Default `auto`, like vantage.
- **Tier-1 verdict (2026-07-03): PASS.** Two-arm scan over the 11 gate-firing bank prompts:
  reach questions survive buckets exactly on access/systems tasks (debug-slow 0.63,
  security-audit 0.66, fix-test 0.61, setup-ci 0.52, gmail-find 0.47/0.58 — on-mission for
  retrieval-with-access) and prune to ZERO on whatsapp-send / research-* / query-db / deploy-app.
  The gate proposes, the formula disposes.
- **Tier-2 verdict (same day): PASS — auto-on stands.** Realized per-lens attribution (n=6
  systems prompts, deepseek judge, `evsi_reach_t2.json`): reach realized_regret **0.351** vs
  vantage 0.362 (n_q=18 each), realized_change 0.584 vs 0.566 — squarely in vantage's band, the
  pre-registered "adds signal, not noise" bar for an exposure lens. Rollback unchanged: set
  `FAMILIES["reach"]="off"` if read-only pollution or diversity harm ever shows.

## Pre-mortem lens (#25) — a fourth question family, auto-on by design

The three existing lenses cover coverage (scoped), premise (contrarian), and source-divergence
(vantage) — but mapped onto `EVSI = Σ P·Δplan·stakes`, **none systematically hunts the `stakes`
term**: the catastrophic/irreversible tail where getting it wrong is expensive. The **pre-mortem lens**
fills that gap: a family whose questions assume the baseline plan *shipped and failed in production* and
hunt the latent hazard (data loss, security compromise, irreversible/destructive actions, silent wrong
output, runaway cost).

- **It is the generation-side, formula-FROZEN half of the deferred "risk-averse tilt."** The tilt
  (reweighting an improbable-but-catastrophic branch) is a *scoring* change → still deferred. The lens
  only ensures the catastrophic-tail question **enters the candidate set** so it can be scored
  risk-neutrally. No formula change; a lurid-but-improbable question still self-prunes on low P.
- **Auto-on by design** (like vantage was), gated by `pipeline._premortem_relevant` — a *conservative*
  failure-surface keyword gate (writes/deploys/payments/migrations/secrets), so read-only
  summarize/research tasks are untouched. Force with `--premortem on|off|auto` / `INFOGAIN_PREMORTEM`.
  Since 1.2.1 both auto-gates match the **raw problem text as well as the framing** — framing is
  model-paraphrased, so a hint verb in the prompt could vanish before the gate saw it (the
  post-rename "migrate prod DB" miss). Hint lists unchanged (verb-only; nouns re-open the
  gmail-triage false positive). Precision re-verified post-change: scored families scan over all
  13 bank+LIFE prompts whose raw text trips a gate — premortem questions survive into buckets
  ONLY on the genuine failure-surface tasks (deploy-app 0.51/0.65, setup-ci 0.60); the doc-writing
  misfire class ("write a brief/plan": write-brief 0.52/0.28/0.0, gtm-plan all 0.0) generated
  candidates but zero survived scoring. No worse than the #25 17/18-pruned baseline.
- **Mechanically:** one `_LENS_DIRECTIVE["premortem"]` entry + one `families_prompt` branch + the gate.
  Nothing downstream branches on lens (scoring/MMR/dedup are lens-agnostic) — every question still scores
  on its own merit; the lens is pure domain *exposure*. Chosen over success-criteria (overlaps the
  stage-0 `success_criteria` framing field), stakeholder (niche; `audience` is already a question
  `type`), and reversibility (folds into the pre-mortem directive) — see the `[[information-gain-skill]]`
  plan for the graded comparison.
- **Do-no-harm posture:** auto-on, but the eval ladder (`score_scan.py` / `validate_evsi.py` two-arm
  premortem off-vs-on, rows now tagged with `lens`/`family`) *confirms* it earns its place — it should
  add distinct realized-valuable questions on failure-surface tasks and stay quiet on read-only
  controls. **Rollback trigger:** if it adds low-value noise on read-only prompts or drops adjudicator
  `diversity`, downgrade `FAMILIES["premortem"]` to `"off"` (one-line change). The measurability caveat
  (absolute realized-stakes collapses, §Comparative elicitation) means the primary evidence is the
  **failure-surface-vs-read-only differential**, not absolute stakes.
- **Tier-1 verdict (2026-07-01, 14-cell two-arm at shipped defaults, `max_rounds=1`): auto-on
  CONFIRMED; rollback trigger NOT tripped.** Failure-surface arms: on true act-and-break tasks
  (security-audit, deploy-app) the lens's 3 questions all cleared the 0.30 floor (0.42–0.70) and 3
  displaced weaker questions into the capped bucket (rollback strategy, pending schema migrations,
  lockout thresholds) — content with **zero** equivalents in any off arm; on lower-hazard tasks
  (add-auth, query-db) its questions scored 0.03–0.22 and self-pruned. Read-only controls: **no
  pre-mortem question entered any bucket even forced `--premortem on`** (values 0.0–0.12) — the
  risk-neutral scoring is a sufficient second net. Cost of the lens on gated runs: ~+6 calls / +30 s.
  One fix fell out: the gate had bare artifact nouns (`email`/`message`/`database`) that tripped on
  *retrieval* tasks (gmail-triage fired, wasting ~6 calls, though scoring still pruned everything) —
  nouns removed, verbs kept; pinned in `test_premortem_lens_directive_and_gate`. Raw runs:
  `premortem_ab.json` (14 cells; job tmp — regenerate via `score_scan.py --families --premortem on|off`
  or `validate_evsi.py --families` for the realized tier-2 arm.)
- **Tier-2 verdict (2026-07-01, realized two-arm, 6 prompts × off/on, all-fast pinned): the lens
  EARNS its slots at the realized level.** Premortem is the TOP lens by realized_regret in the on
  arm (0.416 vs scoped 0.297 / contrarian 0.240 / vantage 0.253); on failure-surface prompts its
  questions realize **0.602 vs 0.386** for everything else (~1.6×), while forced-on read-only pm
  questions realize ~0.045 and are correctly priced at ~0.06 (pruned). Both ladder tiers now
  confirm auto-on; rollback untripped. Full numbers:
  `evsi-validation-findings.md` §"Pre-mortem lens tier-2 (#25) + selection policies (#23)".
- **Independently replicated same day** (deepseek judge, bucket source, different 6-prompt subset,
  34-prompt bank-wide scan): premortem again TOP lens (realized_change 0.984, regret 0.765); zero
  read-only bucket entries; adjudicator-`diversity` trigger explicitly cleared (0.65→0.70). See
  findings §"Independent replication (#25)".

## First-order candidate source (#32) — built, off by default, the first COST-AWARE-gated experiment

The #28 successor hypothesis: the residual P4 gap over the naive `zeroshot` arm is **generation
altitude**, not the value judge — so inject one naive "K best clarifying questions" call's output
as round-1 candidates (family `First-order semantics`, lens `firstorder`), scored by the frozen
pipeline. `pipeline.firstorder_questions` (one `raw_chat` + numbered-parse → tagged dicts) merges
into round 1 when `families["firstorder"] != "off"`; formula untouched. Selector `--firstorder
on|off` / `INFOGAIN_FIRSTORDER`; default `"off"` (absent-key convention — harness cfgs
byte-identical). This is also the first experiment gated on **efficiency alongside Δresult**: every
arm now reports mean wall/tokens/calls, and the adopt rule carries a cost ceiling.

**Gate (2026-07-04, objective outcome harness, n=34 = 20 micro + 14 agentic, K=3, all-deepseek,
`--max-rounds 1`, `--strict-preflight`; raw `~/.hermes/outcome_eval_32.json`):**

| arm | pass | Δ vs baseline | wins/losses | unanswerable | wall | tokens | calls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 0.460 | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| nbq | 0.543 | +0.083 | 9/4 | 74% | 25.0s | 20221 | 38.3 |
| nbq-firstorder | 0.592 | +0.132 | 7/3 | 78% | 29.2s | 23944 | 45.4 |
| nbq-firstorder-behavior | 0.574 | +0.114 | 9/5 | 63% | 29.7s | 24892 | 45.1 |
| zeroshot | 0.734 | +0.274 | 15/1 (p=0.0005) | 31% | 5.9s | 154 | 1 |

**Verdict: NO ADOPT** — the pre-registered rule requires ALL of: paired nbq-firstorder vs nbq
Δpass > 0 with wins ≥ 2×losses; unanswerable ≤ 50%; no lens-payoff regression; and mean added
wall ≤ 10% of an nbq run. Mechanically, on the paired nbq-firstorder-vs-nbq comparison:
- Δpass **+0.049 > 0** ✓ but **6W/6L/22-tie** — the broad-win guard (wins ≥ 2×losses) **fails**;
  the mean lift is a few-task effect, not a broad win.
- **Unanswerable 77% ≫ 50%** ✗ — the naive first-order questions *fish more*, so the strict
  simulator resolves fewer of them (the P4 failure mode itself, now injected earlier).
- **Lens-payoff regression** ✗ — `log-clean` (irreversible/keep-newest class) fell 0.67→0.33 even
  as `json-migrate` rose 0.25→0.75; net wash on the lens tier.
- **Efficiency +16.8% wall** (+4.2s), +18% tokens, +7 calls ✗ — busts the 10% ceiling.

**Diagnosis (the product of this branch):** generation altitude *does* move the mean (nbq-firstorder
+0.132 vs nbq +0.083 vs baseline), confirming first-order exposure has signal — but injecting it
into the EVSI pipeline **does not close the P4 gap**: `zeroshot` still dominates decisively
(+0.274, 15W/1L, p=0.0005) at ~1/5 the wall and ~1/150 the tokens. The pipeline's answerability
handling is the remaining gap, not candidate altitude: first-order candidates enter but raise the
unanswerable rate rather than lowering it. This **triggers #30's re-open condition** (answerability
weighting, previously gated on "post-#32 IF unanswerable > 50%" — now 77%), with the standing caveat
that the mechanism must NOT be self-rated. Stays built, off-by-default, for re-testing; the cost
ceiling now travels with every future elicitation/generation gate.

## Discrimination preflight (#33) — instrument adopted (audit A7)

`validate_evsi.discrimination_preflight`: 8 static forced-choice fixtures (one-token semantic flips
+ cosmetic rewording) with correct answers fixed by construction; score < 6/8 → exit 2. Closes the
gap the old emptiness preflight left open — "a judge that answers but judges randomly still passes."
Opt-in via `--strict-preflight` (8 calls/model). **Live check (2026-07-04): PASS** — `fast` 8/8,
`deepseek` 8/8; both eval-duty models discriminate perfectly. No elicitation change, so no outcome
gate; adopted as a standing (opt-in) instrument.

## Answerability weighting (#30) — retro probe PARK (iteration two, 2026-07-04)

Re-opened after #32 pinned the residual P4 gap on answerability (unanswerable 77% > 50%). Before
spending a build, a **conditional full lap** (`nbq-improve`'s first real use as a protocol) ran a
zero-model-call retro probe to test #30's *premise* — "kept high-EVSI unanswerable questions cause
objective failure" — against the existing objective-harness output (`outcome_eval_32.json`:
per-question EVSI `meta.q_values`, answerability `qa[i].revealed`, outcome `frac`). Probe:
`evals/probe_answerability.py`.

**Premise NOT supported (n=34).** Highest-EVSI-unanswerable × fail r=+0.052 (within SE, no
association); any-unanswerable × fail is degenerate (97% base rate — near-universal unanswerability
leaves no contrast) and points the wrong way. Only a weak continuous whiff (n_unans × frac = −0.22).
**Verdict: PARK #30** — the mechanism (a non-self-rated batched strict-simulator answerability probe)
was pre-registered but **not built**; the conditional gate was honored in commit order. Full numbers
+ the verbatim pre-registered rule: `evsi-validation-findings.md` §Answerability retro probe.

**Why the retro test is weak here (the real product):** answerability can only be a useful steering
signal if answerable high-value questions exist to steer toward; on this corpus they barely do. A
proper #30 test needs a higher-contrast corpus → candidate 2 (nbq→relentless integration) or
candidate 3 (reach→investigate loop, which resolves unanswerables). Re-open #30 only with such a
corpus AND a non-self-rated mechanism (the old self-rated multiplier is still removed — see
"Tried and removed: answerability" above).

**Methodology banked this lap:** cost is multi-dimensional — `verdict-rubric.md` now requires a
pre-registered ceiling per axis (wall, tokens, calls), a bust on any one axis vetoing a result win.

## Reach→investigate (candidate 3, mocked) — NO ADOPT + the intent-vs-state finding (iter 3, 2026-07-04)

Tested whether resolving strict-unanswerable questions via a fixture-aware mock investigator (a proxy
for the reach lens's hop) lifts objective pass. Built an opt-in `nbq-reach-investigate` arm, gated on
the agentic bank (n=14). **0 questions resolved across all 42 rows** — the mock (validated to work on
observable questions) had nothing to resolve because **nbq's high-EVSI questions are about intent, not
observable state**. Unanswerable rose (+2.4pts); the +0.100 arm-mean gap is unpaired
question-sampling variance (0/14 tasks shared questions across arms), not a treatment effect. **Verdict:
NO ADOPT / PARK.** Full numbers + verbatim rule: `evsi-validation-findings.md` §Reach→investigate arm.

**The finding that matters (connects #30 + #29 + reach):** an investigator observes STATE; the valuable
clarifications are about INTENT (what the user wants — crash vs fall-back, which reading, what detail
level). Intent is unobservable by any vantage or hop — it is answerable only by the user. So the
answerability/reachability family of levers (#30 weighting, reach→investigate) cannot help the
questions that matter; it would only demote them. **The value lives in the intent questions precisely
because they are not derivable/observable.** Route forward: candidate 2 (nbq→relentless), where a real
user answers intent — not more answerability machinery. #30 and candidate 3 both stay parked.

## Answer-vs-assume paired ablation (candidate 2 premise-test) — ATTRIBUTION FAIL, instrument kept (iter 4, 2026-07-11)

Tested candidate 2's single-shot premise: does the oracle's real answer to nbq's top-K questions beat
nbq's own assumed default (`modal_answer`), on ONE shared question set per task (paired design
*enforced in-run* — the iter-3 confound cannot recur), with an `answer-lowevsi` attribution control.
Stage-0 power pre-check (read-only, pre-registered ⅓ threshold): GO at 23/48 = 0.479. Gate (n=34,
both banks, all-deepseek, `--strict-preflight`): **Δpass(answer − assume) = +0.093 PASSES** (9W/3L,
clears SE, broad win) — real answers beat assumed defaults — but **Δpass(answer − answer-lowevsi) =
−0.024 FAILS** (6W/9L): answering the low-value tail helped *at least as much*. **Verdict:
ATTRIBUTION_FAIL — Stage 2 (the relentless A/B) NOT greenlit.** Mechanism: the spec-bound oracle
revealed 19% of top-K vs 33% of the tail — nbq's ranking selects intent questions the oracle refuses,
so this substrate structurally cannot attribute ranking value (it rewards spec-answerable trivia).
EVSI↔realized-Δ correlation negative (ρ ≈ −0.20/−0.23; calibration caveat pre-registered). Arm code
kept as a standing opt-in instrument (`--paired-ablation`; existing arms byte-identical; 217→226
tests). Route: the relentless headroom diagnostic (does live relentless leave high-EVSI intent
questions `via:"assumed"`?) — candidate 2 neither proven nor killed. Full numbers + verbatim rule:
`evsi-validation-findings.md` §Answer-vs-assume paired ablation.

### Retro reframe (post-hoc, iteration-four follow-up 2026-07-11 — hypothesis-generating, NO verdict change)

A zero-cost retro probe of the durable gate JSON (no model calls) reframes what candidate 2's value
actually is, and where to point iteration five. **The `answer` arm bundled two ingredients the verdict
could not separate: EXPOSURE (the solver is told these specific things are unresolved) and CONTENT
(the solver is handed the oracle's real answer).** Splitting the 34 tasks by whether the oracle
revealed anything decomposes them: on the 20 tasks where the oracle revealed NOTHING, the answer arm
injected pure refusals ("The spec doesn't say.") yet STILL beat baseline **+0.143** and beat `assume`
**+0.077**; real oracle content on the revealed tasks lifted it only to +0.181. `assume` (nbq's own
guessed modal default) is a wash vs baseline (+0.067) and agrees with the oracle ~1/19. **Learning:
most of nbq's single-shot value here is EXPOSURE, not ANSWERS** — naming the right unknowns and
forcing the solver to handle them explicitly captures most of the realized gain, and it needs no
oracle. The content nbq can synthesize on its own (modal defaults) is near-worthless on this substrate.

**Decision shift.** This is laps 1–3's intent≠state finding measured from the answering side and made
positive: even when intent goes unanswered, surfacing it as an explicit unknown carries the benefit.
Two consequences reshape the route: (a) candidate 2's cheap, high-leverage integration target is
**nbq-as-unknown-surfacer** feeding the planner's open-questions list, not nbq-as-question-router
waiting on an oracle; (b) the exposure hypothesis needs no oracle, so it is measurable on THIS harness
despite the substrate's structural inability to score answer quality for intent questions. **Revised
forward route (supersedes the bare "headroom diagnostic" above):** iteration five pre-registers a
`questions-only` arm (inject top-K as explicit "UNKNOWN — handle sensibly", zero oracle calls) to test
exposure head-on; the headroom diagnostic is reshaped to ask whether live relentless SURFACES
high-EVSI unknowns to the planner (renders them as explicit open questions), not merely whether it
marks them `via:"assumed"`. Caveats: post-hoc subgroup analysis conditioning on oracle behavior
(selection effects), small n, many ties — it generates the lap-five hypothesis; the pre-registered
`questions-only` arm is what can turn it into a verdict. Full synthesis:
`evsi-validation-findings.md` §Retro addendum; queue in `nbq-improve/references/backlog.md`.

## Decided / deferred

- **Decided, keep:** one layer of projected answers (no chain) · within-round semantic consolidation
  only · `--mode focus` default behavior unchanged · report-only (never answers/asks itself) · the
  **pre-mortem lens auto-on** (#25) · the **formula stays FROZEN** (pairwise changes only *how Δ/stakes
  are elicited*, never the √(U·EVSI) form).
- **Confirmation tooling (do-no-harm):** `saturation_scan.py --scored` tests whether the HIGH-value
  signal saturates earlier than distinct-target coverage (it shouldn't keep growing) — evidence that
  breadth is bounded by value, so modest breadth + the families layer is the right coverage mechanism.
  The premortem off/on two-arm scan (rows lens-tagged) confirms the fourth lens adds distinct realized
  value on failure-surface tasks, not noise.
- **Deferred (not bundled):** making `deepseek` the default judge (the "generous judge" calibration
  fix) · the risk-averse *scoring* tilt (its generation-side half is now built as the pre-mortem lens) ·
  a success-criteria / stakeholder lens (documented as the sanctioned "add a second lens later" option) ·
  realized-pairwise stakes for the de-confounded clean floor (#21) · pushing the branch / baking into
  the image.
