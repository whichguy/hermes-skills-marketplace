"""pairwise.py — pure aggregation of pairwise comparisons into per-item [0,1] strengths.

No I/O, no network, no model calls. Deterministic and unit-testable in isolation (like voi.py).

Why this exists (comparative elicitation, #24): a model compares two answers ("which would
change the response more?") far more reliably than it scores one answer in isolation on an
absolute 0-1 scale. The absolute judge's within-task ranking is the skill's one measured
weakness (per-prompt Spearman ρ≈0.34). This module turns a set of pairwise verdicts into a
latent strength per item via Bradley-Terry, then maps strengths onto the SAME [0,1] scale the
absolute judge produced — so the pairwise `delta_plan`/`stakes` are drop-in replacements that
voi.evsi/score_record consume unchanged.

Preserving BETWEEN-task scale (the validated strength, ρ≈0.66) is the subtle part. Pure
within-question normalization would map every question's best answer→1 and worst→0, collapsing
cross-question magnitude and destroying the between-task signal. We avoid that with two virtual
ANCHOR items present in every question's comparison set:
    FLOOR   — "the response stays the baseline (no change)"   → maps to 0.0
    CEILING — "a completely different response"               → maps to 1.0
Real answers are placed between the anchors by how decisively they beat FLOOR / lose to CEILING.
A question whose answers barely beat FLOOR (ties allowed) lands near 0 (low EVSI); a question
whose answers strongly beat FLOOR lands high — so the common anchors carry an absolute-ish scale
across questions, while the pairwise forced choices fix the within-question ordering.

Comparison encoding: a comparison is a tuple (i, j, outcome) with outcome in
    1.0 → item i beats item j   ·   0.0 → item j beats item i   ·   0.5 → tie (≈ equal).
The Bradley-Terry MLE is regularized with a phantom opponent (a conjugate-prior pseudo-count) so
the extreme anchors — FLOOR with ~all losses, CEILING with ~all wins — don't diverge to 0/∞.
