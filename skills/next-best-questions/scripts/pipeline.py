"""pipeline.py — the model-calling stages of the information-gain skill.

Given a PROMPT, produce the raw signals voi.py needs to rank the key questions whose
answers would most improve a RESPONSE to that prompt. Stages (each a role-specialized
Ollama model, mostly via direct /api/chat raw calls run in parallel):

    0. frame_and_plan   — restate goal/response-type/success + a baseline response
    1. generate_questions — find candidate questions that would change the response
    2. project_answers  — plausible answers + probabilities + derivability
    3. judge_plan_change — per-answer response-change and stakes vs the baseline response

Vocabulary note: the JSON keys `baseline_plan` and `delta_plan` are legacy names for the
baseline RESPONSE and the per-answer RESPONSE-change — kept stable to avoid churn; the
prompts and output speak in "response" terms.

Reuse: `build_prompt`, `resolve_alias`, `NON_ENGLISH_MODELS` come from the `ask`
skill's model_utils (resolved at runtime via HERMES_HOME / ASK_SCRIPTS_DIR). The
raw /api/chat call mirrors ask.py::dispatch_single_raw but is owned here so the
many small scoring calls parallelize without the agent-loop / reasoning-effort race.
