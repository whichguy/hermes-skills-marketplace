"""relentless.py — clarify → plan → execute per task → harvest → repeat, until the intent holds.

The deterministic L3 loop over two existing skills (the loop makes no LLM calls; the
`solve` entry's routing gate makes exactly one, receipted in gate.json):
  CLARIFY  — investigator iterate.py (in-process): rank next-best questions by EVSI, research
             the top-K with a full Hermes agent, fold answers/gaps back as tombstones.
  PLAN     — task-decomposer (one `hermes -z` oneshot): the immutable intent + rendered ledger
             become one validated plan.json — ordered oneshot-sized tasks with success
             criteria, or an honest needs_decision / exhausted verdict.
  EXECUTE  — one `hermes -z` oneshot per task; the executor writes result-<id>.json
             {verdict, evidence} judged against the task's success criterion (a missing
             artifact is a failure — disk beats stdout).
  HARVEST  — harvest.py (pure fold): per-task verdicts become evidence for the next
             clarify/replan round.

EXECUTE is itself two nested levels (run_intent_path): LEVEL 2 (run_task_with_local_retry)
gives a failed task a bounded number of local reattempts, each preceded by a clarify
SCOPED to why that one task failed; LEVEL 1 evaluates a pure-code staleness gate
(stale_tail) after every task and, only when it trips, requests a mid-cycle partial
replan (request_partial_replan) of the untouched tail — never overwriting c<N>/plan.json.
Both levels escalate to the unchanged cycle-boundary behavior (next full clarify+replan)
on exhaustion; the human --gate suspend point lives only at the top of the cycle loop.

The evidence LEDGER is the only shared state; the original prompt is immutable (intent) and
each cycle re-renders prompt+ledger for a fresh plan at `relentless/<slug>/c<N>/`. Stop
conditions: SUCCESS (all plan tasks verified worked — the final task is always intent
verification) | information-dry (a full cycle yields zero fresh facts — anti-flap) |
max_cycles | wallclock (cycle-boundary check + a mid-cycle deadline backstop under the
budget cascade; per-oneshot timeouts cap within-cycle).

Written as a resumable-script flow: each phase is a memoized ctx.step, so a crash replays
completed phases from the journal — the memoized plan step keeps per-task step keys
(c<N>/t/<id>, plus c<N>/t/<id>/retry<K>[/clarify] and c<N>/replan/after-<id>)
replay-deterministic, so execution resumes at the first un-journaled task/retry/replan.
Strict-replay rules honored: branch conditions derive only from the immutable input and
memoized step results; clock reads are steps. The only ctx.ask is the planner's
needs_decision fork under --gate (default is assume-and-note: record the open fork as a
gap and let the next clarify round rank it) — a mid-cycle needs_decision from a partial
replan ALWAYS assume-and-notes, regardless of --gate (see run_intent_path).

Runs INSIDE the hermes container (iterate.py needs the ask skill's model_utils). Host-side
use is tests-only (fakes). State:
  ${HERMES_HOME}/relentless/<slug>/   prompt-c<N>.md · ledger.jsonl · report.md · flow/ (engine)
                                      journey.json (the consolidated decision record —
                                      journey.py; report.md is its pure FULL render)
                                      retro.json (post-success hindsight, success+full only)
                              c<N>/   plan.json (receipt) · result-<id>.json per task

Usage:
  relentless.py run    --slug S (--prompt TEXT | --prompt-file F) --answer-cwd DIR [options]
  relentless.py resume --slug S --answer TEXT [--key K]
Exit codes are the resumable-script engine's (0 completed — read result.outcome; 10 suspended
under --gate; 1/2/3 failures). See SKILL.md.

    fold any fresh fact straight into the shared ledger (so LEVEL 1's staleness gate sees
    it immediately), reattempt the SAME task id. Bounded by inp["local_retry_budget"] — a
    plain integer comparison against an immutable config value, so this cannot loop
    forever by construction. On exhaustion, the last attempt's {verdict:"failed", ...} is
    returned UNCHANGED for the caller to fold via harvest.harvest_tasks exactly as today's
    single-attempt failure — escalation behavior stays byte-identical to today, UNLESS
    `allow_delegation` is set and a cheap gate judges the failure has plausible
    alternative methods, in which case a scoped method-explorer sub-run gets one shot
    at the task before escalation (see _maybe_delegate_task).

    A task that succeeds on its FIRST attempt uses the exact same step key (c<N>/t/<id>)
    and result artifact (result-<id>.json) as before this feature existed, and — since
    `deadline` is only consulted right before an actual retry attempt — issues NO new
    ctx.step call either: a task-that-just-works costs nothing extra.

    `deadline` (a memoized wall-clock value, cascade-only) bounds retries against
    aggregate wallclock: checked ONLY right before spending time on a retry (not on the
    first, already-budgeted attempt), so a slow model can't chain unbounded retries past
    the cycle's fair share. The SAME `deadline_hit` flag also gates delegation below — no
    point starting an expensive sub-run with no wallclock left.

    Returns (result, retry_meta) where retry_meta =
        {"attempts": int, "fresh_local": int, "exhausted": bool, "scoped_texts": [str],
         "task_learnings": [str], "delegated": bool}.
    "exhausted" is True whether the budget ran out or the deadline did — both mean no
    more LOCAL recovery is available for this task in this cycle (a SUCCESSFUL delegation
    flips this back to False). "task_learnings" accumulates EVERY attempt's `learnings`
    (failed attempts included, not just the final one) — a failed attempt can still
    surface something worth remembering that isn't captured by its dead-end evidence text.
