"""iterate.py — the Investigator: build context to convergence, then respond.

A dedicated investigator skill, SEPARATE from the `next-best-questions` ranker. It *calls* the ranker
to get the next-best questions, then answers them with a full Hermes agent and folds each distilled
fact into one continuously-growing context (append-only). The loop:

    tombstones = []                                  # answered facts + known gaps
    for round in range(max_rounds):
        evidence = [t.evidence for t in tombstones]  # the shared growing context
        ranked   = infogain.run(problem, evidence)   # rank given everything known so far
        above    = [q in ranked if value >= floor and not already answered][:K]   # top-K BY RANK
        if not above: stop "converged"
        for q in above: tombstones += grounded_answer(q)   # `ask` skill, full agency, distilled
    final = respond(problem, evidence)

Design notes:
- Selection is **top-K by rank** (sidesteps the absolute-threshold problem; floor only ends the loop).
- The grounded ANSWERER is the `ask` skill (`dispatch_single`: full Hermes agent, isolated context) —
  only the distilled fact returns, so the loop context stays lean. Runs INSIDE the hermes container.
- **Capability ladder** (`--capability`, default `act`): full agency by default (all tools, unattended);
  `experiment`/`read` only down-scope for caution. See CAPABILITIES below + references/investigator.md.
- NOT_FOUND is recorded as a plain gap (no revival machinery yet — YAGNI).
- `answerer`/`responder` are injectable so the loop logic is testable on the host with a mock
  (no hermes / no model calls): `--dry-run`.
- **Durability** (`--run-dir`): each tombstone is appended to `<run_dir>/tombstones.jsonl` as it
  lands, and reloaded on re-run — an interrupted investigation resumes instead of re-researching
  (artifact-based resume, the drive.py pattern; no engine dependency). The answerer additionally
  captures each answer as `<run_dir>/answer-<fp>.json` (artifact-beats-stdout; see answerer.py).
  Without `--run-dir` behavior is exactly the old in-memory run.

Usage (inside the container, from the user's project dir):
    python3 scripts/iterate.py --problem "Add authentication to my web app"
    python3 scripts/iterate.py --problem "..." --capability read     # down-scope to read-only
    python3 scripts/iterate.py --problem "..." --run-dir $HERMES_HOME/state/inv-myrun
    python3 scripts/iterate.py --problem "..." --validate top --k 2   # end-to-end test (#21)
On the host (loop logic only): python3 scripts/iterate.py --problem "..." --dry-run

Depends on the next-best-questions ranker (resolved via INFOGAIN_SCRIPTS_DIR / HERMES_HOME) and the
`ask` skill's model_utils (resolved via ASK_SCRIPTS_DIR inside scripts/answerer.py).
