# Investigator — resolve the unknowns, then respond

## Overview

This is the **orchestrator** layer that sits on top of the report-only `next-best-questions` ranker. The
ranker decides *what is worth clarifying*; the Investigator goes and **answers it**, then responds.

The loop is **one continuously-growing, append-only context**:

```
tombstones = []                              # answered facts + known gaps
for round in range(max_rounds):
    evidence = facts(tombstones)             # the shared growing context
    ranked   = next-best-questions.run(problem, evidence)   # next-best questions, given everything known
    top      = [q for q in ranked if value >= floor and not answered][:K]    # top-K BY RANK
    if not top: stop "converged"
    for q in top: tombstones += grounded_answer(q)       # full Hermes agent, distilled fact back
final = respond(problem, evidence)           # best response over the enriched context
```

Each round conditions on the *entire* accumulated context, so the model's implicit posterior sharpens
as facts accrue — which is why we **always append** and keep tombstones clean, high-signal facts.

## When to Use

**Use it** when the task's unknowns are *researchable* and a clarification would *shape the work* —
vague build/spec/integration tasks against a real project ("set up CI for this repo", "add export
to the reports page"), where the answerer can go read the codebase/environment and the final
response should be grounded in what it finds.

**Don't use it** for well-specified tasks (the ranker will converge immediately — wasted rounds),
for questions only the user can answer (it surfaces those as clarifying questions rather than
guessing — but if *most* unknowns are user-only, just run `next-best-questions` and ask), or when a
capable agent would naturally self-investigate anyway (the A/B showed the loop is redundant there —
its distinctive value is systematic coverage + user-only constraint surfacing).

### Example (abridged)

```
$ python3 scripts/iterate.py --problem "Set up CI for this repository." --k 2 --max-rounds 2

round 1: rank -> 2 questions worth researching
  ? Which test suites/commands must CI run?        -> ANSWERED: pytest via tests/run.py (README)
  ? Target platform — GitHub Actions or other CI?  -> ANSWERED: GitHub repo, no existing workflows
round 2: rank (with 2 facts folded in) -> top value 0.21 < floor -> stop: converged

FINAL RESPONSE: a .github/workflows/ci.yml running `python3 tests/run.py` on push/PR ...
TOMBSTONES: 2 ANSWERED, 0 NOT_FOUND   stop_reason: converged (natural)
```

## How to run

```bash
# Inside the hermes container, FROM the user's project dir (so the answerer researches the real repo):
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/iterate.py --problem "<task>"
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/iterate.py --problem "<task>" --k 6 --max-rounds 3 --capability read
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/iterate.py --problem "<task>" --dry-run   # loop logic, no model calls
```

## Capability ladder

Default is **full agency** — it answers questions by any means (read, experiment, real action),
unattended. `--capability` only **down-scopes**:

| `--capability` | answerer tools | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **act** (default) | file, web, terminal | full agency, unattended — current behavior |
| **experiment** | file, web, terminal | restricted by directive to **reversible** experiments (scratch/worktree) |
| **read** | file, web | **read-only** — inspect/search only; action-needing questions return NOT_FOUND |

Capability maps to the answerer's toolsets + a prompt directive (`CAPABILITIES` in `scripts/iterate.py`)
— it does not build a separate permission system. See `references/investigator.md`.

## Per-question outcomes (tombstones)

- **ANSWERED** (`Q → A`) — a discovered fact enters the context.
- **NOT_FOUND** (`Q → gap`) — recorded as a known gap; the final response proceeds with a stated
  assumption. (No revival machinery yet — v1.)
- **user-only** — a genuine preference no investigation can resolve → surfaced as a clarifying question.

## Status (v1, validated with caveats)

End-to-end value is **task-dependent** (de-confounded A/B: helps where a clarification shapes the work,
redundant where a capable agent self-investigates). The ranking it relies on is validated in the
agentic domain (realized-change ρ≈0.66). See `next-best-questions/references/evsi-validation-findings.md`.

## Dependency

Depends on the **next-best-questions** ranker (imported in-process, resolved via `HERMES_HOME` or
`INFOGAIN_SCRIPTS_DIR`) and the **ask** skill's `model_utils` (the grounded answerer/responder run a
full Hermes agent via `dispatch_single`; resolved via `HERMES_HOME` or `ASK_SCRIPTS_DIR`).

**Hub install (dependency order matters — the categories pin the resolution paths):**
```bash
hermes skills install whichguy/hermes-skills-marketplace/skills/ask --category productivity
hermes skills install whichguy/hermes-skills-marketplace/skills/next-best-questions --category autonomous-ai-agents
hermes skills install whichguy/hermes-skills-marketplace/skills/investigator --category autonomous-ai-agents
```

## Verification

- Loop logic (no network): `python3 tests/test_iterate.py` (13 tests).
- Live (in container): `python3 scripts/iterate.py --problem "<task>"` produces a final response;
  `--capability read` confirms down-scoping.
- End-to-end A/B harness: `evals/validate_wrapper.py` (baseline vs wrapper, blind-judged).
