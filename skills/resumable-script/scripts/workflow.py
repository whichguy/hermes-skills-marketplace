"""workflow — a data-defined, durable, LLM-authored WORKFLOW engine (Python reference).

A workflow is a JSON state machine (`{id, version, start, states}`). A small interpreter
compiles it onto the resumable-script engine, so an author (human OR an LLM)
writes *prompts + routing + a function registry*, not control flow. The walk is a pure
function of journaled step/ask results, so it is durable and deterministic on replay for
free — the engine memoizes every model call and human answer.

  load_workflow(spec, registry, llm=, search=) -> Flow   # a Flow the engine can run

Kinds: `run` (registry fn) · `prompt` (one llm call) · `search` (injected web caller -> structured
results, routable via `$.<step>.results[..]`) · `map` (sequential map-reduce over a `$`-path list)
· `ask` (human input: the human produces the step's value, mirror of `prompt`; RENAMED from
`decide`). A `prompt` step may interrupt (an `ASK:` reply) -> a durable human gate whose answer
enriches the conversation -> the step is re-called. See references/workflow.md.

TWO STATE CHANNELS (grep "wf:"):
  - flowing pipe   : a step's `result` is the next step's input by default (`${in}`).
  - named global   : one JSON object; each step's result auto-stored under `$.<id>`;
                     reads via a JSONPath SUBSET (dot/index), writes via set/append/delete.
INTERPOLATION       : ONE `${...}` engine for every string value (prompt/ask templates +
                     mutation sources): `${$.path}` (global), `${@.path}` (this step's return),
                     `${in}` (flowing input); `$${` escapes; a lone `${...}` keeps native type;
                     missing -> "". Bare `$.path` is only for STRUCTURAL spots (mutation target
                     keys, `when` predicates). Spec is JSON (canonical) or YAML (read_spec).
MODEL STEP (v2)    : the TASK call runs the author's directive (pure user message under an
                     engine-owned system prefix) and replies with ONE JSON object (tolerantly
                     extracted; bounded repair) or an `ASK:` line (-> durable human gate -> the
                     answer is woven back and the task re-attempts). A separate ROUTER call (an
                     independent judge; `router=`, defaults to llm) picks the edge when `routes`
                     exist — binding by default, `proceed` only on `"optional": true` steps,
                     `ask` = the reasoned can't-route path. Writes are AUTHORED-ONLY (`set` over
                     `${@...}`).
ROUTING            : `when` predicates first (`eq`/`ne` comparisons; total, never throw), then the
                     emitted `next` label through `routes` (binding; an unmapped label falls onward
                     only on `"optional": true` steps), then the declared `next`, then SEQUENTIAL
                     FALL-THROUGH (next state in declaration order; last -> @done). Terminals
                     `@done` / `@fail`. Cycles are native (per-visit keys) and bounded by a fixed
                     visit-cap safety constant.
CONVERSATION        : prompt steps SHARE one flow-wide conversation by default (the workflow is one
                     context; steps are directed prompts, answers are user turns) — rebuilt from
                     journaled responses on replay. Opt OUT per step or flow-wide with
                     `context: "isolated"`; ${...} holes remain the explicit data channel either way.
