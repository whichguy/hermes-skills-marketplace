"""resumable-script engine — "durable execution, lite" (Python reference).

A flow is an ordinary function ``(ctx, input) -> result``. Side effects go through
``ctx.step(key, fn)``; human/external gates go through ``ctx.ask(key, question)`` /
``ctx.wait(...)``. One append-only ``journal.jsonl`` per run. To resume, the flow is
re-run from the top: a step whose key already has a ``step_completed`` record returns
the recorded result without executing; an unanswered gate raises ``Suspend`` and the
process exits. The user's answer is appended to the journal and present on replay.

Exit codes:
  0   flow completed
  1   flow failed (terminal error after retries)
  2   engine/usage error (bad args, can't load flow, KeyCollision)
  3   non-determinism / replay skew (refuse to resume)
  10  suspended, awaiting an answer
  11  suspended for in-doubt adjudication (non-idempotent step interrupted)
  12  headless run could not auto-answer
  13  busy (another process holds the run lock)

CLI:
  python3 engine.py run    --flow <path> [--input '<json>'] [--state-dir <dir>] [--auto] [--strict]
  python3 engine.py resume --flow <path> --answer '<json-or-text>' [--key <k>] [--state-dir <dir>]

# One invocation (run OR resume) is one pass of Engine.execute():
#   read journal -> Memo (replay view) -> append run_started -> call the flow fn
#   flow calls ctx.step / ctx.ask -> Context._request guards each -> then:
#       step:  completed-in-journal? return it (REPLAY, fn NOT run) : run+journal (EXECUTE)
#       ask:   answered-in-journal?  return it                       : raise Suspend
#   the exception that escapes the flow IS the result: Suspend=10 InDoubt=11
#   KeyCollision=2 NonDeterminism=3 FlowError=1, clean return=0.
# RESUME == re-run the same fn from the top; journaled steps replay instantly, so
# only new work executes. The call stack is never serialized — it is rebuilt by replay.
