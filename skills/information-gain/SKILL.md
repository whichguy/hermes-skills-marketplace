# Information-Gain — what to clarify before you start

## Overview

Given an underspecified problem, this skill estimates the **value of information** of clarifying
questions and reports the ones worth resolving first. It approximates the decision-theoretic
*Expected Value of Sample Information* (EVSI): a question is valuable only if its answer is genuinely
uncertain **and** would change the recommended plan **and** the stakes of guessing wrong are real.
It simulates plausible answers with local Ollama models, scores each question, discards the
low-value and redundant ones, and keeps generating until a diverse bucket is filled.

It is a **reporter / analysis primitive** — it ranks and recommends. Deciding to ask the user, or
researching an answer, is the caller's job (same primitive-vs-orchestrator discipline as `ask`).

## When to Use

**Use it** before committing to an approach on a vague brief, ambiguous ticket, or open-ended ask —
to surface the high-leverage unknowns and a safe default for each.

**Don't use it** for well-specified tasks (it will correctly report "nothing high-value to clarify"
and you've spent model calls to learn that), or when you just want a single model's opinion (use
`ask`), or for a multi-model debate (use `advisors`).

## How to run

The logic is in `scripts/`; run it with the terminal tool. Skill dir: `${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}`.

```bash
# Markdown report (default = focus mode: the prioritized top few)
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/infogain.py "Build a service to sync USAW events into our calendar"

# Breadth mode: wider coverage by SAMPLING the model's own question distribution
# (several high-temperature draws, unioned + deduped) — no seeded topic list.
# Heavier/slower — pair with a fast judge if needed.
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/infogain.py "<problem>" --mode breadth

# Structured JSON for programmatic use (read the bucket back into your reasoning)
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/infogain.py -p "Add SSO to the admin portal" --json

# See the exact stage prompts without any model calls
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/infogain.py "<problem>" --dry-run

# Show your work: every stage's prompt + raw model output + the per-question
# scoring arithmetic (U, the P·Δplan·stakes terms, √(U·EVSI)) + the loop decisions.
# Invaluable for comparing models or scaffolding a weaker one. Add --json for structured.
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/infogain.py "<problem>" --trace

# Iterative loop: fold answered evidence back into the same context; resolved questions drop
# out (they become derivable) and the next-best questions surface. You/the agent drive the loop.
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/infogain.py "<problem>" \
    --evidence "data residency: US-only, no third-party cloud" "budget: free tier only"
# ...or --evidence-file facts.txt (one established fact per line).

# Write to a file; quiet stderr
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/infogain.py "<problem>" -o /tmp/infogain.md --quiet
```

Use `--problem/-p` (not positional) when the text contains `--` or shell-special characters.

### What it returns

Given a prompt, a list of the **key questions ranked by weight** = exploration value =
`√(uncertainty × value-of-answering)` — *how much answering each would improve your
response to the prompt*. Each ranked question carries a **plain-language clarification of what its
weight means** (how much it would improve the response, and the assumption you'd otherwise make and
its chance of being wrong), plus the recommendation (**PRE_ANSWER** ≥ 0.60 /
**ASSUME_DEFAULT** ≥ 0.30). A detailed numeric table is included below the list. If nothing clears the
bar, it says so — the prompt is already specified well enough for a good response. See
`references/design-decisions.md` for the model.

## How it works (4 stages, looped)

1. **Frame + baseline plan** (`plan_model`) — restate goal/decision and the plan you'd give
   *right now* (folding in any `--evidence`); everything is scored as change from this baseline.
2. **Project answers** (`answer_model`, parallel) — plausible answers + probabilities, plus how
   *derivable* each question is (already inferable from the prompt?).
3. **Judge** (`value_judge_model`, parallel) — per-answer plan-change × stakes vs the baseline.
4. **Score / gate / diversify** (pure Python) — `value-of-answering (EVSI) = Σ P·Δplan·stakes`;
   `uncertainty U = entropy(answers)·(1−derivable)`; gate out the no-uncertainty/no-change cases;
   `exploration value = √(U · EVSI)`; collapse same-`target` duplicates; MMR-rank.
   If the bucket is under `min_bucket_size`, generate another round (deduped) up to `max_rounds`.

## Families (default ON — `--families`/`--no-families`)

Before generating individual questions, it first generates **families of questions** for *coverage*:
several **scoped** families (distinct regions of the unknowns) plus three lenses you'd otherwise miss —
a **contrarian** family (challenges the baseline approach itself: *"should we even build this?"*), a
**vantage** family (questions whose answer is *access-relative* — differs by environment / server /
identity / credential / token; auto-enabled only for systems/access tasks), and a **pre-mortem** family
(*assume the plan shipped and FAILED — what unknown would have prevented it?*: data loss, security
compromise, irreversible/destructive actions, silent wrong output, runaway cost; auto-enabled only for
failure-surface tasks — writes/deploys/payments/migrations). It then generates questions within each
family (tagged with `family`/`lens`).

The three non-scoped lenses map onto the value formula `√(U·EVSI)`, `EVSI = Σ P·Δplan·stakes`: scoped
maximizes Δplan-*coverage*, contrarian targets the *premise* (highest Δplan), vantage targets a *source*
of hidden Δplan, and pre-mortem hunts the **`stakes` tail** — the catastrophic/irreversible branch no
other lens systematically surfaces. (Pre-mortem is the generation-side, formula-frozen half of the
deferred "risk-averse tilt": it only ensures the catastrophic-tail question *enters* the candidate set;
scoring stays risk-neutral, so a lurid-but-improbable question still self-prunes on low P.)

Families are **domain exposure only** — there is **no family-level negation**. Every question is still
scored on its own merit (the same EVSI pipeline), so a low-average family can still surface the single
highest-value question (this is common for the contrarian/vantage/pre-mortem lenses); irrelevant families
self-prune because their questions score low individually. The `family` tag adds a tier to the MMR
diversity kernel (`family > target > question`) so selection **spreads across families**, and the
report is **grouped by family** (non-scoped lenses labelled). Turn off with `--no-families` (or
`INFOGAIN_FAMILIES=off`) for the flat generator; force the pre-mortem lens with `--premortem on|off|auto`
(or `INFOGAIN_PREMORTEM`). The families layer runs on its **own model** (`families_model`, default `glm`
— **not** covered by `--question-gen-model`); pin it with `--families-model <alias>` (or
`INFOGAIN_FAMILIES_MODEL`) for offline/reproducible runs. Cost ≈
`questions_per_family × (n_scoped + contrarian + vantage + premortem)`
candidates (~12–18 at defaults), with a one-call fallback to the flat generator if family generation
yields nothing.

## Automating the loop — the `investigator` skill

This skill is **report-only** — it ranks what to clarify and stops. To *automate* the evidence loop
(research the top questions, fold facts back in, re-rank, and produce a final response), use the
sibling **`investigator`** skill (`autonomous-ai-agents/investigator/`), which calls this ranker and
owns the answering loop + a capability ladder. Keeping the answering/looping out of here preserves the
primitive-vs-orchestrator boundary. See that skill's `SKILL.md`.

## Tuning

**Mode presets:** `--mode focus` (default — prioritized top few) or `--mode breadth` (wider
coverage). Breadth works by **sampling the model's own distribution over questions** — `gen_samples`
independent draws at `gen_temperature`, unioned and deduped — so the breadth comes from the model's
uncertainty (the tail of its distribution), not a seeded topic list. Scoring stages stay
deterministic (temperature 0): explore stochastically, evaluate stably. When `gen_samples > 1` the
sampled candidates are then **semantically consolidated** — a `consolidate_model` (default `fast`)
clusters questions that resolve the same underlying unknown and keeps one canonical per cluster, so
high-temperature sampling doesn't pad the bucket with reworded duplicates (it never drops a distinct
unknown; on failure it falls back to the lexically-deduped set). Resolution order is
`DEFAULTS ← mode preset ← INFOGAIN_* env ← CLI flag`, so a preset sets the baseline and any explicit
flag/env still wins (e.g. `--gen-samples 5 --gen-temperature 1.0`).

Defaults live as module constants in `scripts/infogain.py`, overridable by `INFOGAIN_*` env vars
or CLI flags (e.g. `--min-bucket-size 5`, `--discard-threshold 0.5`, `--answer-model qwen`). Model
names are `ask`-style aliases (`glm`, `deepseek`, `fast`, `qwen`, …) resolved via `model_utils`.
`--value-judge-mode absolute|pairwise` selects the Δplan/stakes elicitation (`pairwise` =
forced-choice → Bradley-Terry, the #24 experiment — its powered A/B closed **keep `absolute`**, so
the flag exists for re-testing, not for live use).

## Dependency

Reuses the `ask` skill's dispatch helpers (`model_utils.py`). The scripts resolve it at runtime via
`HERMES_HOME` (default `~/.hermes` → `/opt/data` in-container) or an explicit `ASK_SCRIPTS_DIR`. If
the `ask` skill isn't installed, the scripts exit with a clear message.

**Hub install (install `ask` first — it must land at `productivity/ask`):**
```bash
hermes skills install whichguy/hermes-skills-marketplace/skills/ask --category productivity
hermes skills install whichguy/hermes-skills-marketplace/skills/information-gain --category autonomous-ai-agents
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ollama must be reachable** at `host.docker.internal:11434` (override `OLLAMA_URL`). The script
  preflights `/api/tags` and exits 2 with a clear message if it's down.
- **`glm` defaults to Chinese** — handled automatically (`build_prompt` appends an English directive
  for `NON_ENGLISH_MODELS`); don't hand-roll one.
- **It reports, it doesn't act.** Don't expect it to ask the user or fill in answers — feed its
  shortlist into your own clarify/research step.
- **A short or empty bucket is a valid result**, not a failure — the problem is well-specified.
- **Cost scales with rounds × questions × 2 calls.** Cloud judge/gen models add latency; switch to
  local aliases (`--question-gen-model qwen --value-judge-model qwen`) for fast/cheap runs.

## Evaluating output quality (adjudicated evals)

`evals/` holds an adjudicator harness that decides whether the skill's output is *acceptable*,
not just well-formed. `evals/run_evals.py` runs the skill on `evals/cases.json` (a mix of
underspecified and well-specified problems) and applies two layers:

- **structural checks** (deterministic) — values in [0,1], ranked order, valid recommendations,
  no surviving duplicate `target`s, and per-case **calibration** (an underspecified problem must
  yield several questions; a well-specified one must yield few/none).
- **an LLM adjudicator** (`evals/adjudicator.py`) — a *different, stronger* model than the
  generation stages (default `deepseek` judging `fast`-generated output, to avoid self-judging
  bias) scores framing accuracy, question relevance, value justification, diversity, and calibration.

```bash
# all cases (exit non-zero if any unacceptable — usable as a CI gate)
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/evals/run_evals.py --gen-model fast --judge-model deepseek
python3 ${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/evals/run_evals.py --case reverse-string --json
```

Weak runs are expected to fail (e.g. `fast` + 1 round on a hard problem); stronger generation
(`--gen-model glm --max-rounds 2`) should clear the bar. That two-sided behavior is the point.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `python3 -m py_compile scripts/*.py evals/*.py` passes.
- [ ] `uv run --with pytest python3 -m pytest tests/ -v -k "not live"` is green (pure logic + adjudicator logic).
- [ ] `--dry-run` prints all four stage prompts (confirms `model_utils` import + builders).
- [ ] With Ollama up, a live run on a vague problem returns a ranked bucket and a "pre-answer" list.
- [ ] A deliberately well-specified problem yields a small/empty bucket with the "well-specified" note.
- [ ] `evals/run_evals.py` rates the well-specified case acceptable (bucket≈0) and flags shallow runs.
- [ ] Frontmatter validates (starts at byte 0 with `---`, has `name` + `description`).
